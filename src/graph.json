I took a drive and came across Firehouse Subs. I see online that many people complain about the unison greeting of 1012, Welcome to Firehouse Subs - while at first I thought they were just calling out someone's order number, then greeting me, I heard every employee say the same thing to everyone who came through the doors. Before leaving, I asked the manager about it's significance - it's a standard real-world firehouse greeting to let everyone know that someone has entered. I love it! 

When I told the young gentleman at the counter that it was my first time there, he smiled and explained how everything works and helped me to find just the right thing for me. I was asked several times by different employees if everything was great for me. Again, I love it!

In just a few minutes, they brought my food to me at my table - using my name...I love it!

I tried the New York Steamer sub - very fresh and flavorful! I love it!

The place was super clean, as well. Everyone was constantly working and the manager (I'm guessing she is maybe the franchise owner?) was interacting with everyone and directing them as needed. I love it!

She told me she hopes to see  me back and to please spread the word about them...building brand loyalty - I love it!

I WILL be back - every Thursday afternoon after my chemo appointment...why? Because I LOVE it!

Kudos to the management and staff :) Great concept and great product! I love it!"},{"source": "14SWjEWYny10Cf27kgHpxA", "target": "6VnttIA0M92-d78bd-szwg", "type": "red", "rv": "I went here because I had a doctors appointment in the area. Its an amazing concept that is so poorly executed. First off when i walked in... there was a unison greeting.. .I don't know what it was... everyone talking at once made it almost impossible to understand... something ...something... firehouse subs..... Another person walked in and got the same greeting. I still could not understand it. One of the men working said,  Oh huh first time? then sarcastically said my wonderful manager will explain what we do.  Not exact but close to what he said.  He then gave me a  menu. I ordered my sub after being awkwardly explained how it works.. As I sat waiting for my sub I heard the manager go to an employee. Hey you could finish putting the bag in the trash can... its part of you know what they call a job That's not an exact quote but similar. Joking or not that's rude to say in front of a customer. I could hear that, and if i think that employee's are being miss treated it does not make me want to go there. So I got my sub.. Looks good... Until I found one blond hair on one Side of the sub and a long blond hair cooked into the cheese on the other side of it.  I do not have blond hair. The two men who were working there had short black hair. The two women cooking the food both had long blond hair. One was not wearing a hair net or a cap.... VIOLATION. The food was actually good.

They didn't have a soda that fit that request so someone went to the store and bought a six pack of sugar free ginger ale and kept his glass full all night.  The valet parking was an added delight and all of the food was delicious.  I'm not usually a big pasta fan, but I couldn't get enough of theirs.

We ordered a caprese salad and the carpaccio off the happy hour menu and both were great, although the timing of the items was off - our entrée [Pasta Bravo to share] came out before one of the appetizers.  The very friendly bartender sent our entrée back until we were ready for it.

So - with that being said - Bravo restaurants have become one of my favorite place to eat when traveling. Let me start with the good points.

First of all - though I haven't ever gone to the local Bravo in Buffalo, NY - all those I've been to have offered consistent excellent food. I don't rate all eateries with the same way - I typical rate one common type of establishment with the another. That's why a Burger King has the potential to be a 5 star and so too do the most famous places. Likewise - one of Chicago's most famous could potentially get a 1 star - hope that clears how I rate placed up a bit - for those who care.

On to this review - Bravo and this place was no different from the rest also consistently have great staff - their training/mentoring program must be good. They also know about the food because they actually taste everything - even things they don't typically like are tried so that they can offer informed advice to the customer! 

Another common trait I've found at Bravo is that the place is clean - with attractive decor and their level of cleanliness and decor doesn't stop in the dinning section - they carry this level throughout including their restrooms, which also offer changing areas for infants. 

They are always within our company policy, which also means that their is GREAT value here - and they accept all major credit cards. But the good things don't end there. Every meal is cooked perfectly and the deserts are just as good and always make for a fine ending to an amazing meal with a cup of coffee!

This place gets it all correct - staff friendliness, cleanliness, value, menu selections, specials, timeliness of serving your meal and of course typical parking. If I remain reasonable - it doesn't get better then this. 

Though I am sure there might be an occasional bad experience - I've never had one - so if you have - don't think every trip will be the same. If it continues to happen to you - try being friendly yourself - you might see a huge difference in everything!"},{"source": "1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w", "target": "e8qWaebCnfv2wI8Odmvqug", "type": "red", "rv": "Horrible Service!!!

I ordered the flirty cosmo cocktail which was fabulous. For dinner, I tried one of their new features,  Stuffed Shrimp Scampi made with orzo, farro, zucchini, roasted peppers, spinach and lemon butter. It came with a choice of soup or salad and I ordered a small bowl of wedding soup. I really enjoyed my soup and entree.  Very light and tasty and I would definitely order it again. You got all of this for $12.99.  The only negative comment I have was the service itself. If you plan on coming here on the weekend, you may want to keep your schedule open. There were tons of big parties this particular night and our waitress seemed to be very overwhelmed. We could see her running back and forth many times trying to catch up. Remember when I said that our reservation was at 5:30PM? We didn't leave out of there until 9:30PM and that was not because the conversation at the table was so good. We were waiting! Waiting to place food orders, waiting for the checks, waiting, waiting, waiting. I was hoping I would have been out of there by 7PM at the latest. I'm sure it wasn't solely our waitress fault. I'm sure the kitchen was backed up and all of the staff were sharing just 2 computers to place orders and print checks.  Like I said, BRAVO was packed with dinner guests.

I went this past weekend with my parents.  We'd originally thought about going to Brio -- my mother really likes their ravioli.

Perhaps it was a bad day, but, while the service was excellent -- the actual food was a bit disappointing.  My father had steak flatbread, we shared calamari, my mother had a grilled chicken, and I had chianti braised beef ravioli.

We were rather disappointed.  The calamari doesn't have the hints of jalepeno that mark Brio's version - breading was thick, and a bit overwhelming to the poor squid.  

The pricing is lower than Brio's... and the menu selection is biased towards a slightly simpler fare (IMO).  

Given that the two are relatively close geographically, I think this was an attempt at market segmentation.  Bravo wasn't bad - it was fair.

I try to skip national chains when possible, but it's not always possible.  I got the cheesecake and a caffe toscano, and my wife got the chocolate chip bread pudding and a bellini.  

The cheesecake was what I would call cheesecake brulee and I'm sorry... cheesecake doesn't need to be screwed with.  If you're an executive chef that thinks you know better than generations of New Yorkers, at least give your patrons the option of a plain jane cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself sucked, even after I chipped all the caramelized sugar off.  It was like it was made with low-fat ingredients, which you just can't do.  Bad crust, too.

My caffe toscano (coffee, rum, bourbon, and something else) would've been good had it been made with coffee that wasn't weak.  My wife's bellini was frozen and blended.  Excuse me?

They do a good Sunday brunch we've found! 

Not wanting to go the diner route, we said why not' after learning that Sara's does not do brunch on Sunday. 

The crab cake eggs  benedict was quite good, the bloody mary only so-so. The frittata at the table next to us looked tasty. Most dishes come with some fried potatoes that are a tad too grease-ola for my taste. Brioche toast is available as a side, however they did bring a nice little bread basket.

There was no wait for  table, service was quick, food came quickly and it was relaxing enough to scan a newspaper and chat in peace. I refuse to endure a long wait for either a table or food at Sunday brunch -- something so many of the other east side options suffer from.

I recognized some of the menu choices as being the same or similar as Brio, another chain Italian restaurant - which must be in the same restaurant group as Bravo, but unfortunately the quality at Bravo didn't much what I've experienced at Brio.  

No need to return."},{"source": "1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w", "target": "ZsmfGhv2AqHd1UiGJ99xZw", "type": "yellow", "rv": "I loathe chain restaurants with a zeal that can only be described as fury, but Bravo! is one of the few chain options that I not only tolerate, I actually enjoy.

Bravo's focus is Northern Italian food, which is not your typical Americanized Italian.  Northern Italian style food is lighter, simpler, and fresher.  Americanized Italian is what most American's think of Italian; heavy/hearty red sauces, including heavy meat sauces, overloaded cheese, tons of pasta, and the only veggie in sight is a iceberg lettuce salad.   Having traveled to Southern France, near the Italian border, my wife and I love Northern Italian food and hate Americanized Italian.  The latter just makes us feel sick and bloated.

The single defining characteristic of Bravo that I notice is that there is a freshness level to the food that is not typical in other chain restaurants, and that has brought us here more than once.  For example, their pizza and flatbreads use real fresh mozzarella (not shredded and bagged) and fresh basil.  My favorite pasta dish has pine nuts and fresh spinach.    

After multiple dinners there, my wife and I have always enjoyed everything we've ordered.  The flatbread appetizers are especially good; my wife often makes a meal of just the flatbread appetizer and a salad. 

I typically get the Penne Mediterranean with chicken which is always good.  I like the fact that they use multi-grain pasta and the olive oil sauce is light, without being overly bloating like other heavy pasta dishes can be.  Another notable point is that their pasta dishes can be ordered in half sizes, but it's a little more than half the price of the full dish.   I usually order the half size pasta because it is more than adequate for me, the net bill is lower, and there is no waste to be thrown out (or brought home in a doggy bag).

My wife and I are also tiramisu freaks and try to sample each restaurants' version whenever we dine out and it's on the menu.  Bravo's version is very good, not the best I've ever had, but still very good.

Lastly, I've found Bravo to be kid friendly and have had success brining my two-year old there for dinner.  My wife and I usually go for an early seating (5-6pm) and during the summer sit on the patio.  The noise level of the restaurant or patio drowns out my toddler's occasional random noises, he especially enjoys coloring on the paper table covers, and the wait staff has been great with him. 

In summary, my wife and I consider ourselves restaurant snobs and target patronizing independent places, but Bravo has turned out to be a solid option; especially when we have a kid in tow and need something convenient and casual enough for a toddler.  Bravo also has turned out to be a decent fall-back option when I travel on business and I'm stuck in a location that little other alternatives.  Unlike other chain restaurants, food freshness and quality doesn't leave me feeling disgusting when I leave there."},{"source": "BjnJKoYFmjBRHUCCcUkiwg", "target": "-kMn9KvDYmTMeroUf3nVfg", "type": "red", "rv": "I've been here only once, and it was just OK. Not wanting to eat too much, we shared a house salad and a fish & chips (beer-battered cod, chips, hushpuppies, and coleslaw). The salad was a bit limp, and the cod wasn't outstanding nor bad, just average. They didn't do a great job of the beer batter, however -- I would say it was over-deepfried (ie, a bit burnt). The chips were average, hushpuppies weren't great, and the coleslaw was also a bit limp. The fish was not seasoned, which could be good or bad depending on your tastes. On the upside, our waitress was very nice and amenable to us sharing (both the house salad and fish & chips came out halved, on separate plates, for us, much to our surprise), though she was slow at times.

My wife and I would go to Mitchell's about once a week.  It would be a quick happy hour dinner then a movie.  We eventually started going elsewhere to try something different.  Not to long ago we decided to go back.  

In between there I believe the management had changed.  Typically during happy hour we would get the fish tacos which were pretty good and crazy cheap.  Other than that it's normally an overpriced piece of fish that usually is pretty good along with a nice atmosphere.  

Not too long ago I would have given them 5 stars but based on the bad service recently, lower quality food, and newly smaller portion sizes I'm being generous and giving them 3/5.  When a higher priced establishment cannot accommodate you by serving you from their bar menu when they carry all of the same items normally I feel like that's a problem.  I am not asking you for the happy hour price, I am just asking for the same items I normally get because I like them.  Charge me triple!  I don't care.  

On top of that there is a person there who relentlessly places a reserved sign on the booth tables in the BAR!  Yes, in the bar.  When you can make reservations at a restaurant with tons of seating I wouldn't imagine I would want to be seated in the bar.  Also when I show up at 6:00 p.m. on a Friday and the place is mostly empty and the bar is where I'd like to sit I shouldn't have to deal with a reserved sign along with a snotty comment by my server asking if we're going to be eating dinner.  I'd prefer a nicer booth and not being crammed into a small booth, sitting on a bar stool or at a high top table.  

Sorry, I may be a little disgruntled but for the price you will pay here you shouldn't be treated this way especially if you come here often enough and keep coming back with this type of service."},{"source": "BjnJKoYFmjBRHUCCcUkiwg", "target": "4pdakPwk1llsSZLwxD1fTg", "type": "red", "rv": "Bad food.

  I ordered the lobster duo - a 4oz. lobster tail that comes with lobster pot pie. The lobster pot pie was -- no exaggeration -- an ordinary biscuit. The biscuit had a little slice at the top, and then they drizzled some flavorless pink sauce over it that had a couple kernels of corn in it. There was literally one small chunk of lobster meat on the pot pie. It was crud. I sort of wish I had sent it back and just cancelled my order, but I was with a group and didn't want to make a scene. But it was that bad. 

  The lobster tail was cooked to s*** -- extremely overcooked and basically ruined. The drawn butter was probably corn oil with coloring. It did not taste like butter at all, and it did not have the consistency or flavor of butter. It was probably just corn oil. Disgusting.

   It was by far the worst seafood experience I've ever had, and I'm including my visits to Arthur Treachers. This is basically a glorified Red Lobster, but at least at Red Lobster you get fed. I ended up eating the leftovers from my fiancee's plate (fish fry) because I had just eaten a $30 appetizer and was still very hungry after my $30 dinner. My entree was completely unfilling and unappetizing. It was pathetic. The real tragedy is that people spend their money at this place because it is in a high-end shopping plaza, but the food at Mitchell's Fish Market, based on my experience, was worse than Red Lobster's (a low-end chain seafood restaurant). 

   Don't let them lure you in with their tall dessert cakes, though -- they suck at seafood and that is what matters. If you want dessert, go to an ice cream shop or a bakery.

  For others' sake, I would recommend spending your money elsewhere. I hope this place goes out of business. 

   The only nice thing I have to say about it is that they had decent margaritas (the 1800 Margarita...it actually has alcohol in it, surprisingly...but their food was so crappy I half expected their drinks to be all filler)...

    The last annoyance came when they charged the wrong credit cards on a split check (between two couples...so in other words, not difficult). But they charged us our friends' bill on our card and then charged our friends our bill...so, the service is not top notch, and not even really that competent. 

    Edited once because I think I was being unfair and harsh about the wait staff, who were polite."},{"source": "BjnJKoYFmjBRHUCCcUkiwg", "target": "AyYKTOCL5qM8589oBsqbfA", "type": "blue", "rv": "Lets start with two things.

One, Mitchell's is consistently good seafood no matter what city I eat at. Mitchell's in Pittsburgh, Cleveland Ohio, Carmel Ind.
These restaurants are sharply appointed with beautiful and comfortable tables and booths. There is a reception area with a host/es and comfortable upholstered benches for waiting. Inside they all have a very ample and well appointed bar area. There a many seats at a U shaped bar, with some high-tops and 2 and 4 person booths. When alone I will usually eat in the bar area. The service is very good in this section, but it usually good all through the restaurant. As I recall they all have a private separated room for large parties.

Two, really, let's start with a Martini, say Grey Goose up with blue cheese stuffed olives. Okay, now I'm ready to eat.
I always enjoy a version of their very fresh and very good Ahi Tuna appetizer. This time served with Sushi rice, ponzu and apricot ale sauce including pickled ginger and nicely hot and tasteful wasabi. This is outstanding Tuna, seared very rare. My other favorite appetizer here is the clam chowder. This chowder is so very thick, rich and clammy. Soooo good. 

A loaf of warm sourdough bread is served with fresh butter. Enjoy as you see fit. I will say that I try to take it easy on the bread, but my gosh, it is really good sourdough. 

For my entree I have probably two strong favorites. First and perhaps at the top is the Chilean Sea Bass, served Shang Hai Style, which is steamed with ginger and scallions, served with sticky rice, spinach and rice wine soy sauce. This dish so outstanding. First if you love the buttery soft texture of the sea bass, and you'll love it with this preparation.

My other outstanding favorite is the Cedar Plank Salmon, preparation is balsamic glazed and oven roasted, with delicious, mouth watering grilled zucchini and peppers,sun-dried tomato pesto and goat cheese. This combinations works so well. I find this to be just an outstanding meal.

Mitchell's has several deserts, but by the time I get there I usually pass. But I have tried and recommend the Shark Fin Pie, which is butter fudge ice cream, honey roasted peanuts, fudge,peanut butter, with  Oreo cookie crust. I also enjoy what they call their Triple-Chocolate Mousse Cake. But my favorite is the Key Lime Pie which comes with a Macadamia nut crust. I love the lime, and the the stronger the lime flavor the better.

I would suggest that anyone who enjoys seafood will enjoy a meal here."},{"source": "BjnJKoYFmjBRHUCCcUkiwg", "target": "bGA80YIUq2iyJXEGZVdKeQ", "type": "red", "rv": "To start, I normally love Cameron Mitchell's restaurants.

The food on the other hand... It was delicious but would of been better if it was served warm rather than cold.  We had to make some changes with the soup because their lobster bisque was very bitter and bland.  Horrible combination if you ask me.  The New England Clam Chowder was amazing!

My husband and I made reservations thru Open Table, arrived at the allotted time and were immediately seated in a booth.

There was a little bit of a wait for the entrees, but we did have fresh bread and butter to snack on, while we waited.  When the food arrived, it was just ok.  The salmon, shrimp and scallops were all overcooked.  The salmon was borderline mushy, instead of tender and flaky.  The scallops were a bit tough and shrimp were tiny and tough.  There was a huge portion of rice in a soy/teriyaki type sauce and an ample portion of green beans.  The flavor profile was on-point, but the proteins were disappointing.

We went there several years ago (wasn't very good then either) and haven't been back until today.  MISTAKE. Our waitress was Anna.  We refused the bread and while I understand she seemed surprised, (cuz everyone loves bread, right?) made a face and scoffed a bit about my refusal.  (Sorry, we didn't want bread). She seemed in a hurry for us to order because she had to come back twice, but I wasn't ready.  

Husband ordered Lobster Bisque soup for $7 for about 3/4 of a cup.  It was room temperature and nothing like the bisque you can get for half the price and quality at Piada and no where near the quality of Hyde Park and Texas de Brazil. It was not smooth and creamy but very tart. I thought it was too tomato tasting.  I was glad I did not order it.  

Onto placing our dinner order - after the quality of the soup I decided NOT to order a $35 meal so I opted for something that would be difficult to mess up.   I got a grilled chicken Caesar salad and asked that the lettuce not be tossed in the salad dressing, but wanted  the dressing ON THE SIDE.  Husband got the crab legs. Easy enough - right?HA. 

Anna didn't give husband a shell cracker, the seafood fork, nor butter. A different lady brought our meals. Husband had to use his hands to crack the legs and a dinner fork to eat the crab.  My chicken was overly charred and actually it was not even a full breast of chicken (for an extra seven dollars??!) but looked as of the breast had been sliced in half.  My salad had dressing all over it and they were kind enough to supply an EXTRA SIDE of dressing.  

Anna was nowhere to be seen.  We began to eat. She noticed that husband was using his hands and a dinner fork and hurriedly brought the scrap bowl, the cracker and the fork, and hurriedly left again for an extended period of time.  Then later she came back and asked how everything was.  We were about done at this point.  I explained to her that the salad had dressing all over it despite me saying I wanted it without dressing. Instead of apologizing, she began to argue that she thought I had put dressing on it because they usually give two sides of dressing but I only received one.  Then she asked if she could get me another one.  I declined.  Where was she 15 minutes ago?

The manager came over and spoke a little too loudly.  Servers were staring.  She asked if she could get me another salad and I declined.   Husband made his statement about the utensils not being provided and asked if butter should have been provided and the manager said it should have been provided prior to the meal coming out.   Manager stated that she would let Anna know about that and walked away.  Okay...?

I thought the manager was actually going to adjust our check and our check was brought to the table. It was for the full price.  No adjustments made whatsoever.  I wasn't expecting free meals, but some sort of discount.  NOPE. 

Husband gave the credit card and I thought they may adjust it then.  NOPE. Then Anna proceeded to depart our table and was so obnoxious saying goodbye and have a FANTASTIC EVENING!  Ya thanks Anna.  You too.  

My suggestion is that if you're planning to go to Mitchell's, take another hop, step and a jump to Texas de Brazil in the same parking lot.  There - you can get an all you can eat salad bar with FRESH ingredients AND a lobster bisque (that is also to die for) for less than what you would pay at Mitchell's.

So, I told him ONE of the MASSIVE things I'm coping with...just in case he returns and I'm crying (I felt it coming on...). His kind, reassuring words helped me to avoid the feeling. Douglas let me know I was in the right place. After making sure I was set with a menu, questions answered, he said the bar staff would ABSOLUTELY make a Lemon Drop Martini. (It wasn't on the menu, so I panicked; thought I'd have to eat next door, instead). Douglas made me feel much better as I enjoyed dining alone (one of my things). Instead of sadness, I thought of the many good times with my friend.  
I was able to enjoy a quick drink and appetizer. The Shrimp Pot Stickers were perfectly prepared and delicious. Douglas seemed to know a grieving girl needed carbs...Thanks for the bread, Bro' - (AS IF...with an appetizer!!)...His manner of authentic, charasmatic, skillful service completely relaxed my emotions. I could see he was equally attentive and quickly returning to all of his customers (kudos to the kitchen). 
Look - I was only there for QUICK martinis & tapas (I told myself as I walked in; polish on my toes was still wet.)...
Eventually, I thought....I LOVE GREAT SERVICE, AND SADLY - IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND....Therefore, I'm staying!  
I ended up ordering the Perfect Pair: Lobster & shrimp stuffed lobster tail, crab stuffed shrimp, smashed redskins, asparagus. The kitchen staff should be commended. My meal was perfectly prepared...promptly served...Thank God for Douglas and the Team!!. My friend would NOT want me crying over delicious food!

Happy hour consisted of:
$3-4 dollar draft beers.  Most of the appetizers were half off.  We tried the artichoke dip which was served with tortilla chips (super rich and creamy), shrimp cocktail (perfectly steamed shrimp served over ice with cocktail sauce), Asian shrimp (these were deep fried and had an sweet glaze and served with rice and small cucumber salad), crab cake (perfectly pan fried with tasty tartar sauce).  No complaints from me.  

Just glancing at the menu, the entrees seemed a little pricey.  I think most of the fish entrees were between $25-30.  The quality of the seafood in the appetizers was excellent,  so I imagine the entrees would be similar.

This review is long overdue and I hope to spare fellow yelpers from wasting their time and money at one of the worst dining establishments in the area. 
Over the years, I've tried giving this particular restaurant the benefit of doubt since all other Mitchell's Fish Market restaurants in the region (OH, MI, KY) have met or exceeded my expectations. Having dined at this location no less than a couple dozen times over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the poorly trained, rude and obnoxious waitstaff, along with their awful service, poorly prepared food, and apathetic managers are the norm and that they can't be attributable to everyone just having an off day. The Incompetencies from the floor manager(s) to the people working in the kitchen are pervasive. Waiters regularly forgetting or omitting food orders, kitchen serving poorly prepared and/or cold food, and unapologetic managers unwilling to address complaints are just a few examples.
Yelpers, do yourself a favor and avoid this particular Fish Market.

I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass cooked with their signature method which is Asian style on a bed of rice. It was Delicious! However the sauce was soaking in the rice and would make it too saucy towards the end so I had to move the rice away from the sauce at the beginning of my meal. The wild caught salmon was surprisingly not dry or fishy like most wild salmon are. It was moist and most enjoyable.
I also had the clam chowder that was filled with clams! As most people may have experienced, clam chowder usually lacks the clams, this one was the exception. Not salty or greasy the clam chowder was one of the best I've had. Maybe the best I've had!
This is not the quite type restaurant if you're looking for that but it has a classy atmosphere with the dim lighting etc. There is also a bar and outside seating where you can enjoy the fine weather and fountain

We had a reservation for a party of 8 and were seated on time.  Tucked a bit out of the way, but at least we were able to hold a conversation since the room wasn't crowded. It made my wonder why they were stating there was a 30 minute wait to those arriving when half the tables near us remained empty the entire evening. 

We waited 10-15 minutes for our server. In fact, another server came by to say she'd be there shortly. Once she arrived she took our drink orders, which took about 20 minutes to arrive. She returned to bring water and take our orders for appetizers, which, sadly, arrived before our drinks did. Service was slow throughout the evening, and although she was courteous and did the job I can only say she was average. 

I ordered the bourbon glazed salmon which was overcooked and cool when it arrived. The glaze was hard and crusty on the bottom and I ended up leaving that on the plate. Without the glaze the salmon was bland. My husband had the shrimp and chips, which were also overcooked. The hush puppies were hard and dry, and everything arrived lukewarm or cold. We've had better at local franchise restaurants at half the price with better service. 

I looked over the menu online before we went, as I try to make healthy choices when dining out, and noticed that the prices online were not updated. Cocktails listed at $8.25 were $10 and food prices were also higher.

We were assured by the manager that the kitchen would get this right. We were praying he was correct, but unfortunately he wasn't. The third pass was the worst example of a filet I had ever seen. There was fat and gristle throughout the meat and again there was no lobster. We gave up.

We had reserved a private room for our party of eight, and were not disappointed by the abundance of hot, crusty bread, large wine menu, and pleasant wait staff -- which included a woman who seemed to be one of the managers, helping out with a smile.

We started with the calamari and artichoke dip served with tortilla chips.  I indulged in a Columbus Pale Ale and copious amounts of bread and butter (too much, likely) before diving into the Shang Hai Seafood Sampler, a cornucopia consisting of fresh Atlantic salmon, scallops, shrimp, sticky rice, sesame spinach and rice wine soy sauce.  Presentation was excellent and the sauce added a delightful gingery kick to the proceedings.  Even our three year old was entranced by the clash of flavors.

All in all, a nice dining experience for a chain in an upscale mall in suburban Ohio.  As much as I don't like to let my Brooklyn/New York food snob side show, sometimes it's hard not to judge places like this -- there's just so little that's distinctive about them.

On our most recent visit, we had ordered a salad, a slice of pizza, two pastries, coffee, and a soda (all were readily available behind the counter). 

We received our soda and coffee, along with a numbered card, and found a seat while we waited for the rest of our order to be brought out. 

We waited 15 minutes for our fairly basic order, until I went up to the counter, numbered card in hand, and politely inquired how much longer it would be. 

A dismissive employee greeted me with a rude What'd you order?. 

While telling her my order again, she cut me off mid-sentence and said, We'll have it out when it's ready. Go sit down and we'll have it right out. 

A few minutes later, the food came out and it tasted all right, but there's no reason we should have had to wait 15+ minutes for food that was already sitting right behind the counter when we ordered it. 

At a normal sit-down restaurant, 15 minutes would be acceptable, but this place should be the equivalent of a Panera with their serving times. 

Also, it should be noted that on this recent visit, there was a guy who looked like the owner, walking around the restaurant. You would think the employees would be on their best behavior when he's around, but apparently not.

They always have super fresh bread options, if you're into trying fancy new breads. Also, totally random, but their coffee options are awesome. My favorite is the mint hot chocolate.

Could the restaurant be a little cleaner, like other Yelpers state? Sure. But I think the kids who work here do the best they can. Earlier this week, I stopped in for a late lunch at 3pm, and it was a revolving, bustling door of patrons come and going, particularly young people. That's tough to keep up with.

I can tell that a lot of Clevelanders love this chain too, because this store gets swamped. Weekends are a no-go: carts flying everywhere, people running into each other, barely any space to move. Even if you stop in on a weekday in the middle of the day, the store feels full. This branch is really small, and its awkward, cramped layout contributes to the claustrophobic feeling.

The one drawback to TJ's is that sometimes an item you really love will just up and vanish one day, never to return. Never could get a solid answer why, either. But, them's the breaks, and I end up finding something else to love anyway. Love the free samples, too! The wine selection is decent...some great finds for under $15. Sure, some of the real cheapies are cheap for a reason (paint thinner), but try a few and you WILL find some winners that compete with bottles that go for $50, $100, and beyond.

I used to HATE grocery shopping, but I loved coming here...the employees were always friendly and helpful (well, with ONE exception), and unlike other grocery stores, if the checkout lines got a little long, somebody would always open up another one. I was never more than 3 people deep in line, ever. Oh, and bring your own bags...you get entered into a weekly raffle for some free stuff. Besides, its the smart thing to do anyway.

He asked if I was doing anything special and I said no and lamented over the fact that I had just moved here to start an internship and didn't have friends yet.

-Quality you can trust.  The food is always good and they have a wide variety that will match pretty much anyone's taste. 

-Friendly staff.  Realized you forgot something while you're waiting in line?  One of the employees will go grab it for you.  Want to try a new recipe but not sure what ingredients work best?  Ask one of the employees for help.  Not only do they help because they get paid to, but they genuinely all enjoy doing it.  I have yet to meet a cranky TJ's employee.

-Healthy options are the rule, not the exception.- Hate eating processed foods?  Are you a vegetarian or vegan?  Prefer organics?  TJ's has everything you need to fit your lifestyle.  

-Great prices.- Many grocery stores sell food at exorbitant prices.  Not TJ's.  You get some of the best quality food there is without paying an arm and a leg for it like you do at places like Whole Foods.

PS:  almost forgot, (people without cart edicate follow closely) you know who you are!!  I think.  Just everyone follow.

Carts are nice.  Not when pulled up right in front of where I'm looking without regard for anyone but you you you-mostly middle aged ladies with a sense of grocery store entitlement!  Ok here's what ya do.  

LEAVE your CART in some out of the way place (or in the way most likely) and go get what you need down the first aisle and come back to place it in ur awaiting chariot at the end of said aisle.  If not done with aisle, go once again dear friend into the breach until aisle is exhausted of potential purchases.  Next.  Move cart to next aisle over, anywhere should do really.....now (this is important)       LET THE CART GO. 

That's right take your HANDS OFF the CART and walk to interesting food products and stare at labels, talk to friends, chastise husband, look longingly at chocolate bars, chocolate chips, chocolate syrup ect.   Now back to cart with chocolate/wine products in hand.  Unload into parked cart that may have been moved by others to see some wonder behind.   STAY YOUR ANGER!!!   The contents have been unbruised.  (The metal cage protects all manner of wine and chocolate)

Repeat until you are all aisles are exhausted.

Remember the cart is not a battering ram or some mid evil rampart that allows you secret access to a three foot section of food products!  It is but a lowly tool, best left to its own vices, drifting aimlessly in the aisles of my favorite store, awaiting your eminent return.

Just remember to LET GO of the cart!!   EXCEPT EXCEPT  EXCEPT at the very end when you have unloaded all the spirits and fine delicacies into your auto.... Now FIRMLY GRASP THE HANDLE and take this beast of burden back from whence it came.  DO NOT let it wander aimlessly in the parking lot to damage others cars even though you may have done it for years uncounted.  Turn but this new leaf and a great sense of pride may fill your heart.

So to recap:  LET GO of the cart inside and GRAB HOLD outside!!"},{"source": "BPyopyEntbl4obte91gNrQ", "target": "Ky2nn0TYhH3PuwHPALt7Lw", "type": "red", "rv": "I don't like this location.

This is a fairly small location, so it can definitely get crowded with people at times. Hint: Stay away from this place during nights & weekends. The lines can get insanely long!

Not because it's over priced, but because I seriously want to try everything. Hmmm, I've never tried that? Throw it in the cart! You can totally do this in real life. I mean, I've never had anything I didn't like here. 

One of my favorite parts about Trader Joe's is the bread selection. There aren't many places where you can find multi-grain sourdough bread, and even sprouted wheat rye. Holy goodness. Toast either of those up with some butter and you won't stop eating it. Trust me...(stupid carbs.)

I also just love the variety of foods: ethnic foods, a fabulous organic selection and everything pretty dang cheap. Off brand beers and wines for almost nothing, but plenty of fancy vino too. 

I'd say just about the only thing I don't like about TJ's is the busy factor. I always feel like I'm fighting for my life here, even amongst the hippies and the soccer moms. If it's a weekend, dare you even try to come here, you'll always be in someone's way. It doesn't matter where you stand. And if you're looking for something, it's almost inevitable that you'll have to ask someone to move. It's beyond infuriating.

I finally stopped in after hearing so much hype about this chain of grocery stores.  Well, the reason I haven't stopped in is because the nearest one is 20 miles from home.

I'm going to write a letter and ask Trader Joe's to open a store near me.  Better yet, I'll buy a house in a neighborhood that has a Trader Joe's!

Anyway, the selection and quality of food is really good.  The store is smaller than I expected, but every inch of the store is stocked with quality goods.  The wine selection looked pretty good and I found myself wanting to taste some, but none was available and no one was around to open a bottle.

Until I move to a better neighborhood, I'll be left wondering what life with Trader Joe's would be like.

I love the variety of grocery items they have without being overwhelmed by aisles and aisles of stuff. I also love the service, both the floor workers and the cashier workers are friendly and helpful above and beyond what is necessary. 
All that being said, I absolutely hate how crowded all Trader Joe's seem to be. Even though this place has now moved to a new, improved, bigger location, it still felt swarmed on a Monday afternoon. I can only chalk it up to the layout of their stores and the tiny aisles. I know this is part of their business model, but I can't help but wish there was just a bit more elbow room while doing my grocery shopping. Outside of these complaint though, I really can't fault TJ's for anything else. Both product and service are great, and I will continue to come back regardless of the space issue!"},{"source": "BPyopyEntbl4obte91gNrQ", "target": "sLt06K1TAZZpYgibO7aqGw", "type": "red", "rv": "Always a great adventure - new treasures to be found every visit.

You can get some great dinners from their frozen food selection. They also offer plenty of other things, such as produce, wine, cheese, health foods, and various other food products.

It's still pretty stressful to shop in there, but look, it's a Trader Joe's, and we're all just robots to the frozen food section. But there's some pretty notable, awesome things about this upgraded location that make battling the reaches of soccer moms worth it.

Where to begin...
-Quality, inexpensive flower section. Nice looking stems, as well as succulents and other small potted plants.
-Hello, wine and beer wall! I see you. Expansive selection, or build your own six-pack.
-Generally wider aisles.
-The flow seems to be a bit better, though if you remember the old location, everything in the store is reversed. It took me a minute to find my way around.
-More parking! I had ZERO issues finding a spot.

Living on the west side, I try to make a somewhat regular trip to Woodmere to stock up on my favorites.

It was so packed, it was a tad frustrating when trying to navigate the aisles. I don't think I could solely shop at this store if there was one in my area but I do like that they have a lot of unique food items. Since I knew I wouldn't be back to Trader Joe's for a while, because it's so far from where I live, I made sure to really look at everything they had to offer. My favorite part of the store was the frozen foods section. There were hundreds of frozen foods I'd never seen before. So, here's what I bought: cookie butter, a trio of flavored olive oils, cinnamon coffee cake, frozen lobster ravlioli, frozen orange chicken, frozen orange juice (as recommended by a friend), creamy gorgonzola, frozen naan, frozen mac & cheese bites, a smoked ghost chili grinder, and a few clif bars in flavors I've never seen before. Total bill was $40. My favorite item so far is the cookie butter. I could literally eat it with a spoon. Actually, I did. Anyway, the lobster ravioli is delicious but you don't get much in a package. Enough for 2 people. The coffee cake was tasty. The gorgonzola, well, I guess you have to like stinky, moldy cheese, I don't. Not sure what I was thinking there but it was awful. Haven't tried any of the other items yet. The lady who rang up my groceries (Tora) was very nice and talked to me a lot and seemed to really like her job.

I usually don't like going to the grocery store very much--Dave's does their best to single-handedly raise America's inflation rate and Giant Eagle, although better on prices, really doesn't have any charm to it and I believe that very few of their sales are good.

Trader Joe's, on the other hand, is a place that I could go on a daily basis. 

The *only* drawback about this place is the distance from my place in Little Italy. That's why I make sure to go to this one or the Westlake one whenever I'm even remotely close to them, because they are amazing and I always find something new and innovative on the shelves.

The prices on some products here are great, such as produce, wine, orange juice, and random other stuff around the store. I absolutely love their product selection here and never fail to be thrilled by the wide variety of flavors and products that one can purchase.

One particularly great aspect of Trader Joe's is their flower selection. I always enjoy bringing my wife new and different types of flowers from Trader Joe's...best of all, they're VERY reasonably priced too.

All in all, Trader Joe's is worth the drive no matter where you live.

For one, we went on a Saturday night and two, my friend was handicapped so he needed specific seating. That certainly wasnt going to happen quickly especially since the place isnt wheel chair friendly. The interior is tight. I mean, VERY TIGHT. There is no passing on wheels without asking people to stand up and move their seat. I had to make my friend come in on his crutches. (-2 bad interior & bad for handicaps)

The service was great. I absolutely loved my waiter. I tipped her because she was so kind and sweet, not so much for the food. (+1)

OMG the food. I forgot the name of my dish, but what i ordered was rice and veggies. I guess i shouldn't have expected much. But damn. It was as bland as boxed mashed potatoes without seasoning nor butter. The rice was bland, the veggies were bland. I mean, Chipotle makes better rice and veggies then this place. My other friend ordered sushi which totaled 12.99. When he got his plate, he was pretty pissed to see that it was only 6 pieces of sushi and it didnt even look that special. You could buy that from giant eagle for half the price! (-1)

The highlight of the day was the Bubble Tea. They have the best bubble tea I have ever tasted in my entire life. Everyone got something different and i loved them all. (+1)

I, like many of my fellow reviewers, prefer the Coventry location to this one. There are a few reasons for this, in my opinion. The Eton location offers a smaller Japanese menu and no Malaysian menu. The Eton location is also very small, and can get swamped on weekends and during peak lunch hours (just like the other Eton restaurants). Because this restaurant is so small, they tend to only have two or three servers on staff, so the service can get a bit slow.

All that being said, the food here is delicious, and is a better Japanese restaurant than most others on the East Side! One of my favorite dishes to order here are Hamachi kama appetizer, which is a grilled, rich and fatty yellowtail collar. Another favorite of mine is the Chirashi, which has several different kinds of sashimi over a bed of rice and pickled vegetables. A chirachi lunch is a particularly good deals, since it comes with miso soup, a salad, and the entree for about $13.

I'll get the gripes out of the way first...the hosts (owners?) always seemed a bit off to me. Like the time we walked in during a weeknight, with two tables occupied, and were given grief for not having a reservation. I dunno...maybe because getting a reservation at a restaurant, in the Cleveland suburbs, on a Tuesday, is utterly pointless? And, as illustrated by this current situation, totally unnecessary? Try smiling and being happy that you have customers...it helps!

Ok, that out of the way, the sushi chefs at the bar were always great. Not the best I've ever experienced but better than many. The food itself was good-not-great, never bad, and adventurous enough. 

I heard that the Coventry location was better (and cheaper), but alas I never got to stop by in my brief Cleveland adventure. I suppose this location fell victim to the Eton experience (vomit).

Best. 

Sushi.

In Cleveland.

Nevermind the small dining area. Nevermind the sometimes long wait for your food.  This is the best sushi you can wrap your chopsticks around. As stated in my previous review, you absolutely have to try the Manhattan Roll. One bite of the impeccable combination of spicy shrimp, tempura crunch, nori, rice, and smooth avocado brought together by the creamy seafood sauce (which is liquid CRACK) will turn anyone into a believer.

BUT, the real reason I am updating my review is because I recently discovered the Empire Roll, which gives the Manhattan a run for its money. It consists of spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and tempura crunch held together with a thin, soft rice paper and covered with 4 different sauces. This gigantic roll (and believe me, it is huge, in both individual size and the amount of pieces) delivers a massive combination attack to your palate that will leave your appetite fully satisfied and down for the count. I now have my top two must-haves every time I go to Pacific East.

Simple rolls more to your liking? They've got it covered. Their sushi/sashimi menu is diverse, and everything I've tried is fresh, delectable, and of course, HUGE, so you know you are getting your money's worth."},{"source": "fTfX3vGrV8GYBGcfweY6Kg", "target": "DpPQDEG1vlBIf9D-z8g-xQ", "type": "red", "rv": "Traveling through the area, I was looking for something that I had not had in a while and prayed that it would be delicious: sushi came to mind.

I ordered the Sushu & Sashimi Lunch Special. The fish was very fresh and really good. The rice was also soft and a little sticky the way that it is supposed to be. It was all very delicious.  The sashimi was cut thick and the sushi was also cut thick and the portions were both fresh and generous. 

The only complaint that I have is that fresh, raw fish should be served cold. Although everything was still delicious, the fish was a bit closer to room temperature and that took away from the experience.

I am not a big fan of miso soup, but was able to sub the shiitake mushroom soup for a $2 upcharge (well worth it).  The salad was fresh and dressed with ginger dressing.

What else? The hot food is good, filling soups and my kids like the grilled salmon. The appetizers are good and the presentation is nice. Service is good and the owners are kind people.

Putting the whole roll in my mouth was not an option as the roll was just too bulky.  

My friend ordered the chirashi (a variety of raw sliced fish over a bed of sushi rice) however even he said that he became a little disgusted by the presentation.  Picture eating heavy thick slabs of raw fish over rice.  Slabs vs slices are an important detail.

Great sushi.  As has already been covered in other reviews, theirs is among the best you will find this far from salt water.  Service is attentive, prices and portions are both in better proportion than most other high-end places around Cleveland, and the grub gets to table quickly.

The one-star deduction:  The place just ain't that pretty.  When we stopped in to make reservations, after walking through the grand columns and entry door, I assumed there may be two or more dining rooms, perhaps a nice bar/lounge area... Nope.  One pretty small dining room.  NO bar.  (No booze, either, just beer and wine.)  I guess the rental costs on this particular shopping strip must be pretty steep, hence the diner-sized table area.

A-OK is what it says.  And that's what Pacific East was last night.  The food was 4 stars and the overall experience was 2.

My first impression upon walking in was what a dump.  I was really disappointed in this.  We were led without greeting by a host that seemed to be under an exceptional amount of stress (despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty at 6:30pm on NYE) to a table on a nondescript wall.  Not just nondescript, but in bad shape.  There were huge gouges in the wall, and they were not fresh.  There wasn't a single thing on the wall other than orange paint.  I felt like I was in a warehouse.  A poorly maintained warehouse.

Our food came relatively quickly, and for the most part, it was delicious.  I had two complaints on the food.  One, in the Empire Roll, which is 3 different kinds of fish and 4 different kinds of sauce, the fish was a paste.  Maybe I should've known this because it was spicy X, Y and Z as in spicy tuna but what is the point of having 3 kinds of fish if they're going into a blender?  Also, the futomaki are just too big.  Sushi etiquitte demands popping the whole thing in or biting it clean in two, and neither is really possible.  I ate them whole, but I looked ridiculous and felt ridiculous.  The flavors were all good to great.  The fish quality was very good.  The steak in the Land and Sea roll is not steak.  It is roast beef from the grocery deli.  FYI.

My other huge complaint was the gaggle of teenaged girls at the table next to us.  Two of them were dressed like whores.  One was showing 2 inches of thong out of her ridiculous and inappropriate outfit, and the other had a skirt that had a half inch inseam.  The others were way too done up for 16 year olds, and they were obnoxious.  Loud conversations about which ones of them had had sex.  Lots of high fiving.  One of their daddies must be a regular because they had several things delivered on the house.  This is the future of our country.

Unfortunately, the other clientele is part of the experience.  And this experience was merely A-OK.

The sushi here is very good. The Xmas Roll is particularly festive and quite delicious. The Philadelphia Roll is one of the best I've had.

The prices on the Coventry web site (since the Eton web site is broken) are either not the same or it is badly out of date (and the reviews from 2002 suggest it is outdated).

This evening I managed to arrive at a time where there was room at the sushi bar, but was told that there would be at least a half-hour wait for a chair (?). Upon pointing out that there were empty chairs at some of the tables, I was informed that they weren't available for the sushi bar.

I ordered a simple sushi deluxe platter.  The texture of all of the fish was tough and stringy.  The fish was cut way too thick, and was far too large for the bed of rice it was served on.  Other than the eel, the fish all tasted eerily similar too.  I didn't realize that was possible.

About that rice.  Good lord. I didn't detect a single shred of evidence that this was prepared in a sushi style.  It was basically what you get shoved into a little white box when you order takeout from your local Hunan Wok.  

I honestly don't know if I've ever eaten a smaller percentage of a plate of food that was put in front of me, as my standards tend to dip pretty low when I'm hungry.

The waitress was a sweet little girl and I actually couldn't bring myself to look her in the eye when she came to ask how everything was going. Her cheerful attitude was probably the sole redeeming quality other than maybe the miso soup?

I initially SQUIRMED but decided to GO WITH THE FLOW.  The last time I had sushi in the eastside of Cleveland, I was very disappointed.  We ended up at Pacific East and were seated promptly.

I did a quick glance of the place and it looked clean.  It had a more conservative feel to it based on who was in there and formal intimate vibe that I got.  When I grabbed the menu, I expected the place to have overpriced sushi (we are in the old money part of town).  My gut instincts were TOTALLY WRONG.   

I chose to eat a 15 piece Sashimi meal for $21.  This started with three pieces of Salmon, Albacore, and Mackerel. Then it included two pieces of raw sweet shrimp, white fish, and white tuna.  Why did this not add up to 15? Well, I am not complaining.  The fish pieces were bigger than average and very fresh (exception was the Mackerel).   I left SATISFIED and curious about how the rest of their fish selection would taste like.

I feel that their execution is lacking, here's why:

(Background: I travel all over USA and I've been trying this style of pizza. I've had MOD, Blaze Pizza and Rapid Fired Pizza)

- Upon entering the place, it was trashed and very dirty. (The ambience reminds me of a cafeteria) 
- the ingredients are basic and remind me of frozen tombstone pizza with subpar ingredients 
- The Cutlery/napkin/toppings area seems like the focus was saving money. A big stack of paper plates, some crappy packaged toppings, and some no brand boxes
- the staff seemed flustered and a little unorganized (maybe they had a big rush not that long ago?! I came around 5pm)- they were still friendly

Overall I feel that the owners of this chain decided to get involved in the fast fired pizza craze and they cut corners everywhere they could to increase the profit margins. It feels like a solid AVERAGE 3 star establishment. 

If you are a local, as of this writing- there isn't a MOD or Blaze pizza nearby. This seems to be the local chain of Cleveland. So, not having other options, this place is pretty dope. 

(There is one Blaze pizza joint in Canton- and one coming soon in Mentor- so if you're in those areas, give it a shot and you will see what I'm referring to).

If you are looking for a quick, hot, delicious personal pizza, than this is your place. This place is comparable to Pie Five and Blaze Pizza, which are in other cities across the US. You can order a pre-set option or choose to design your own personal pizza. I ordered The Refund pizza, which comes with sausage, onions, & red and green peppers. It normally comes with fresh mozzarella, but I chose shredded mozzarella. The pizza is cut into 6 slices. I like that the crust is thin and a bit crunchy. 

Later that night, I had stomach cramps. My coworker also experienced stomach cramps. We both ate there and we both had sausage and meatballs on our pizzas.

We ended up sitting for another 7 minutes waiting on our pizza to be created and fired. Not only that but I got a combo with a salad and that wasn't even made. They make it when you arrive.

I give it 4 stars on the strength of its neat create-your-own-froyo-sundae business model. I'm not gonna lie: it's pretty fucking fun. The frozen yogurt itself is okay. There's usually about a dozen or so rotating flavors. It took me a few trips to really get the hang of creating something that didn't taste like the noble citizens of Candyland died a thousand deaths in my mouth, but I've now mastered the temptation to make frogurt tornadoes, mixing flavors and toppings willy-nilly without any plan in a feverish attempt to satisfy my sugar-addled inner child. Now, I think it out. Last time I went, they had apple pie frogurt which I mixed with French vanilla, and then added caramel sauce, caramel turtles and Nilla Wafers for a nice apple pie à la mode vibe.

Because of this self-serve business model, I don't think it's fair to compare it directly to one of the other great frozen treat places Cleveland has to offer. Though it's never going to best Honey Hut or Mitchell's or Jeni's in a blind taste test (nor should it, as the others are ice cream places), Menchie's traverses the line between eating and activity, consequently creating its own niche.

When you get there, feel free to ask for sample cups before you start. When you're ready, just grab a cup (or for a little extra, a cone) and choose whichever frogurt flavor(s) you want. The cups are pretty big so be careful when dispensing your yogurt as you can easily fill it up with more than you actually want. The toppings bar is loaded with a wide variety of cookies, candies, nuts, fruit, sauces, and even friggin' Golden Grahams. When you're done, the cashier charges you by the ounce. If you break it down against other ice cream/frogurt places, it's a little on the pricey side, but I think it's still pretty fair.

Menchie's has a unique exterior compared to the rest of the brick facade laden storefronts in the Eton shopping plaza in Woodmere. The exterior is lined with flashy, glittery, purple mosaic tiles. Inside, it's like stepping into a Hello Kitty lunch box. Cramped, way too happy, too much pink and an anime-esque logo stamped throughout.  

The ordering process is unique in that it's completely self-serve. Choose from a variety of flavors, pull a lever and fill your cup. Next is an assortment of toppings available buffet style. They have everything from traditional condiments to captain crunch and apple jack cereal to spoon onto your frozen yogurt. In the end, you pay based on weight. 

I wasn't too happy with my creation. It looked and tasted like a complete mess. The whole process was just too overwhelming for me. Since it was so crowded, I didn't really have time to figure a proper mix of yogurt flavors to complimentary toppings. At the time, I just felt rushed. Kids all over the place, fairly crowded and it was loud. There were no recipe cards to follow which would've been helpful. I like more structure and order and this place just didn't do it for me. Perhaps the whole, here's a cup, now go have at it! approach works for some. I'd imagine kids love it here. But it's just not for me.

Price-wise, Menchie's seems about the same as--or possibly a little cheaper than--other self-serve froyo places I've been (this includes places on the West coast, where the froyo craze has been around for a while). I never really kept track of exact pricing. 

Overall, Menchie's is pretty standard among self-serve froyo places. The additional perks that put it above average include the free membership deal for repeat offenders ($5 on every $50 you save), and the fact that most of their flavors are kosher, if you have those dietary concerns.

Still, the food leaves some to be desired. While the dessert was so deliciously prepared to perfection, the meat struggled with consistency. Our waiter told us the meat would be prepared medium rare, and some pieces were, while others were given an inedible char.

Great ambience, great service and best of all what's not to love about skewered meat? There are several cuts to choose from, but my favorites definitely are; the signature sirloin called the Picanha -- a slab of NY strip with that delicious strip of fat on top, the flank steak, and the beef rib (elusive, it doesn't come out often, but I have my eye out for it, trust me). 

You can't go wrong with any of the other cuts: pork ribs, chicken parmesan, parmesan pork, tenderloin, lamb leg, lamb chops, bacon-wrapped chicken, garlic sirloin, filet mignon, bacon-wrapped filet, sausage... man the options are endless. I'd say millions, even billions. Believe me. All well-seasoned, fresh-tasting and delicious.

Then there's the salad bar which also doubles as a side dish station, if the mashed potatoes and candied plantains they set on the table are not enough. You can come in and just go for this salad bar without the meat, but why?! Ok, maybe if you hate yourself... That's also cool.

This is eat-all-you-can. I was impressed by the other patrons who ate like champion competitive eaters, but disappointingly, I gave up after one plate. I was defeated.

For a high end restaurant like that, the manager's conduct was totally unprofessional and we will never go back there anymore unless a new manager is in place. 

The waiter was very apologetic and was very nice.  

My friend dealt with the corporate directly and got her broken camera reimbursed.  The manager has not apologized for what he said nor had he contacted her after.

We also mentioned one in our party wanted me a little more cooked and she only ended up with a couple pieces of flank steak.  The filet never made an appearance at our table which was a shame.  My husband left hungry -- something that should never happen at Texas de Brazil.  I will always love the salad bar but people come for the meat and expect to leave in a meat coma with that kind of price tag.  It'll probably be a while until we return and I've also learned my lesson that it's a waste of money to bring someone who doesn't like medium-rare because they won't get nearly as much to eat. As a party of 5 this was a $300+ meal. 15% off is insulting.

Update: While I appreciate Texas de Brazil's corporate office reaching out to me, I'm not pleased with the result. I did email them as they requested and they sent me a 15% off coupon that can only be used on the meal...dessert isn't even included.

Last night my husband and I finally made time to treat ourselves and celebrate our 16th anniversary with a very special meal.  I am so happy we chose this!  From start to finish our meal was absolutely magnificent.
We made reservations for a Tuesday night at 7PM.  The restaurant was not crowded and there was no line waiting.  We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  She not only pulled out our chairs for us, but placed our napkins - even asking me if white napkins were OK, or did I prefer a black one. It was truly a detail in all my years of dining out I had never been asked.  She introduced us to Tony, our waiter for the evening and he explained to us about our meal. At Texas De Brazil you can have simply the salad bar or you can have it with the meats.  I cannot personally see why you would come to a Steak House and order a salad buuuut to each his own.  The salad bar is beautiful and it has all sorts of lovely items, fresh hearts of pal, tomato, romaine and endive, fresh mozzarella balls, even sushi, boiled shrimp, smoked prosciutto  and more. It is a gorgeous spread and laid out quite lavishly.  I sampled the romaine with their blue cheese dressing, some smoked prosciutto, mozzarella and a bowl of their lobster bisque.  It was the most unique bowl of bisque I ever tasted.  There is no meat in it at all but it had the best flavor I have ever had in a bisque. I highly recommend it. 
My husband had a small salad plate as well sampling the cheeses, prosciutto, onion ceviche and the potatos au gratin.  He too enjoyed his selections.  It was then we began our true adventure of the evening....our meal.
You have a disk by your glass that is red on one side and green on the other.  If you leave it on green carvers will come by your table with the most wonderful skewers of everything from chicken to bacon wrapped filet. It was heavenly.  We both love meat and so it was fun to taste all these magnificent flavors. My favorites included the Brazillan Picanha, bacon wrapped fillet, braised beef rib and the bacon wrapped chicken.  My husband agreed he loved the Picanha and the beef. I can honestly say for 30 minutes we were just in awe of how many items we were offered and how great they were.  As I told him I never even went back to get the Au Gratin Potatoes because I truly did not miss them... the meats were so good they truly needed no accompaniment. I did try the potatoes Tony brought to the table and they were very good!
Now I will say we were really full but since we were celebrating we split a piece of Key Lime Pie and I took home a piece of the Brazilian cheesecake.  Both were just as wonderful as they looked and I cannot wait to have them again!
We will definitly be back for more. It's just too good not to.  Is it pricey? Yes but its worth it!  I would rather pay $44.95 and have a great meal and enjoy as much as I want of as many kinds of meats as I want than $25.00 for a plate of one item that might be done half this well. Now there are some things I have learned like - the water they bring you costs $6. I will pass on that next time.  And cokes are $3 each so I might limit myself to one not 3.

The interior is beautiful, the staff is very friendly. We've been going to another similar establishment in downtown Cleveland for years for special occasions, we will never go back there! Texas de Brazil is closer, and the salad bar and quality of meats were WAY better.

I highly recommend the Potatoes Au Gratin on the salad bar, I couldn't stop eating them! The salad bar is very nice, well worth the price, the dressings are delicious and the huge wheel of shaved Grana Padano cheese, and the basket of perfectly cooked bacon just took it over the top, I almost wanted to eat nothing but that! I have absolutely no complaints about the food, all the meats were delicious and moist. Especially the steaks, the salt rub they put on them is so good! 

My only complaint was the overbearing service. There's a fine line between taking care of a guest and making them feel smothered. Every time I left the table, my napkin was refolded, and the waiter physically handed it to me to put it back on my lap, it felt silly. My water was filled about 8 times, which felt like every time I took a sip it was refilled. Our waiter was always hovering/circling around us, I think we were his only table, and we were visited by two separate managers to see how things were. 

Just a little privacy would've been nice, the meals are already understandably invasive with the gauchos coming with the meat selection, I'm expecting that and I'm okay with that, but when my husband and I didn't even have 2 minutes alone it's just a bit much. Maybe this was the case because we were there at 5 on a Sunday and they were slow, so they were bored, maybe when it's busier it's less intrusive. It's much better than being ignored by a server obviously, but maybe just take it down a notch.

As for the Gauchos and the meat- fantastic. All of them wanderer around and bring to your table every possible cut of beef, pork, sausage, and lamb you can imagine. Additionally, various sausages. You simply say yes or No if you want it or not. This is in addition to the great salad bar. You can really spend the whole night here and leave 10 pounds heavier.

I was pretty excited for these items because I have never had vegan or gluten-free anything on purpose. What can I say.... I like my meat and gluten.

I ate the brownie that night after dinner. It did not have any almond flavor, was more of a cake consistency, and definitely bitter. Now, these all sound negative but from what I know, brownie preferences vary. So I would say that if you like fluffier brownies and dark cacao, then this is the brownie for you. I, however, do not. I like 'em dense and chocolate-y sweet! I saved the scone for the next morning before a huge test. I woke up feeling not so good :( and figured it was something I ate for dinner. But still, I ate half the scone while driving to my test. It was decent but a little salty. Later on, mid-way through the exam, I just started having a heavy rock feeling build in my stomach. Stomach cramps, nausea, and lightheaded-ness hit me. Ugh. UGGGGGGHHHHHHHH. Ugh ugh ugh.

Long story short, I spent the rest of Saturday dying from stomach pains. Sunday was spent recuperating/expelling the remnants. I haven't eaten anything solid in 48 hours and Gatorade is now my best friend.  Now, do I blame VST?

Being new to the area I had NO IDEA that this place was actually INSIDE the Eton mall.  Indeed that is probably the main take home point, as my GPS was right....but its very disconcerting to have a GPS say congrats you are here and not see a store front.  Anyway, just go in and its pretty much right there.  
When I arrived, there was one person working the counter, so I got to roam around and look at all the products.  That's when I saw it... a chocolate cupcake with a cloud of frosting and a chocolate covered pretzel.  I had to get two.  In fact, while i was there I ended up going a bit crazy and adding 2 gf cake pops, a gf brownie, a gf scone and a gf chocolate chip cookie to my collection.  Before I start overly gushing about the baked goods, the only negative was that the chocolate chip cookie had a bit of a different taste that due to personal preference i would not order again.  That being said, it was a moist cookie with good texture.  However, probably the reason for not ordering the cookie... would be because I'd have to fill a few bags with those aforementioned cupcakes. OH MY GOD!  The cake was light, a bit sticky but amazingly chocolatey.  The frosting was pure perfection and I basically melted with the chocolate covered pretzel on top.

I am allergic to dairy, eggs, coconuts and nuts, and the bride had gone gluten-free, and so Vegan Sweet Tooth sounded like a good option. The rest of the family would eat the desserts provided by the caterer.

When I called, I requested the biggest round, one-layer cake they had, which I learned would feed about 20 people, and requested a vegan gluten-free cake with a Hawaiian wedding theme.  To help them figure out the cake decorations, I told them that the bride was classy, and valued great beauty, rich color and brilliant blues, and also simplicity, so that they could get an idea about what she would like. Nothing showy or flashy, I said. They had three flavors, and I went with a white cake with a white frosting after some recommendations on decorations from the person I spoke with.

Oh my goodness, was I thrilled.  When we picked up the cake, I told the young woman ringing up my order how lovely the cake was! It was a proper wedding cake, simple, beautiful and with rich color.   She looked to be about 16 years old, and to my surprise, she said, Oh my gosh! looking relieved.  I did it this morning, and I am so happy you like it!  She beamed. 

Next, the taste:  First of all, the bride and the bride's mother were thrilled with the cake's decorations (and I didn't think they were just being kind).  I got a huge slice of the cake, and it was moist, flavorful, and had tiny hints of spice to it.  The icing was a buttercream, and though the cake had some of the sponginess that gluten-free baked goods tend to have, it did not detract from the experience for me.  Due to my food allergies, I have tasted vegan cupcakes and cakes all over the country, from San Francisco to Phoenix to New York. It was definitely the best gluten-free & Vegan cake I have ever had.  My husband did think that the cake was a little dry for him, however he finished his slice with gusto and claimed it was delicious.  The bride and other guests also enjoyed their cake, and one guest asked, Where did you get that cake?  It was delicious!  So, Vegan Sweet Tooth has already gotten a recommendation.

I do appreciate a good cupcake but the truth is that it's less about the cake than about the frosting, amirite?  It's more like a little special sweet - and a lot of cupcakes have frosting that is overly sweet or overly fatty and oily tasting.

However, when I was visiting my mom in the Cleveland area in August 2011 - I saw that there was a vegan bakery not too far away and had to make the trip.  We got a dozen mini vegan cupcakes of all different flavors and we agreed that about 9 of 12 were winners, and a couple flavors were okay.  

I think one of my favorites had some kahlua in it, another was caramelly - and there was a blackforest one - I think I'll have to revisit to refine my preferences and scare the super straight, rich white ladies sitting around in this schmancy shopping mall playing mah jong.

I'm not vegan, nor GF, but vegan desserts always fascinated me. I'm always down to try new things. Let me tell you... I don't think you can even taste a difference. If you shut your eyes, you'd never know something actually was vegan. 

They have a nice variety of treats ranging from cake pops and cookies to scones and cupcakes. In my small box to-go, I had a brownie, 2 buckeyes and 2 small cupcakes (red velvet and French toast). The buckeyes were ooey gooey wonderful and the 2 small cupcakes had punchy flavor. The brownie was also huge, but I wish the frosting had more flavor.

Just be patient when you visit them, as they are a true small business, and only one gal was juggling multiple customers and cake phone orders. I think they are worth the wait and the visit, and if you are in fact vegan or GF, I imagine this will be your treat heaven.

We also split one of the oil-free brownies and it was sub-par. The lack of oil made it really chewy in a bad way and it just wasn't as good as I had hoped. 
The second visit my mother went for the same choc/vanilla cupcake and I got one mini red velvet and one mini Kahlua. The Kahlua was pretty good but not my favorite. The red velvet was AMAZING.

Holy sweet balls, this place was amazing!

Awesome full bar with seating and about five flatscreen plasma TVs, a pickle bar (the hell???), and the servers don't use pen and paper to take your order. They walk around with their own personal hand-held devices to take your order, send it to the kitchen, and even cash/check you out with. So rad.

Our server was (thank God) knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations.

I had heard of this place, but I was skeptical to try it, as I had heard it was a vegetarian place (which doesn't make a lot of sense, whatsoever).. to clarify, they offer vegetarian menu items! ANYWAY, let's get back to the BEEF...

I chose the Thin Lizzy burger. Had it cooked medium. I pretty much orgasmed the entire way through my meal. The Lola fries are amazing (sea salt and rosemary, WHAAAAT).

To finish, I ordered the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon milkshake.

I know what you're thinking.. Ew. What the f--k?

Seriously? I am big on anything sweet, and even I was freaking out, but it was so worth the bazillion calories I drank in a span of ten minutes.

It's a thick milkshake, and believe me, you can taste the vanilla, the apple pie, and of course the BACON! They even put bacon bits (the real sh-t, not the crap you buy at Wal-Mart) on top of the milkshake. 

Do yourself and your stomach a favor, and go here. I swear, you won't regret it. If you do, then you probably don't have much of an open mind, and therefore, you probably suck.

It's a very meaty burger so definitely not for the faint of heart.  I tried my friend's vegetarian (portobello mushrooms) and it was good, but Shake Shack shroom burger is better if you're going down that road.  Also tried the Lola burger, which is light-years better than the burger at Tremont Tap House; sunny-side up egg and bacon also comes standard (vs. as an add-ons at Tap House) in the Lola burger.

Someone mentioned the price...I think $9-10 for these burgers are a steal! (for comparison: Tap House Burger with aforementioned add-ons is 12.50, Fat Head's Spicy Cuban (also an awesome burger) is $10.

I started with the tomato blue cheese soup. It was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I was even nice enough to share!

My dad and I split the Lola, which my brother ordered as well. The fresh beef they use for these hamburgers is out of this world. The burgers really don't even need any toppings; they just put the burgers over the top! I'm not going to lie, I regretted the choice to split my burger- I learned from my mistake and will never do this again!! 

My mom decided on the Shroomage (portabella burger). Unfortunately, our server came back to let us know that they ran out of portabellas to make that burger. My mom was pretty disappointed, but she was a sport and ordered a different one. The manager later came over and told us that one was on the house.

The fries are also really good...perhaps because they are fried in lard? What makes them even better are the variety of homemade sauces you can dip them in.

Don't forget the pickle bar- lots of homemade pickles and other fun toppings/sides to have with your burgers. I definitely got my fill of pickles that night...yum!

We asked to order appetizers - again not without ordering our main course and then everything comes out at once.

I am pregnant and had been craving a burger for a week.  My favorite burger is a burger with mushrooms & cheese - so a burger with mushrooms, sliced onions and cheese would be perfect, except I can't have soft cheeses (the blue cheese) that came on the burger.  I asked for a substitution and was firmly told no.  I was not trying to be picky but soft cheeses are strictly forbidden.  So I ask for a regular cheeseburger instead - the response - what kind of cheese would you like on it?  

I would never go back to such an inflexible establishment.  It's ridiculous.  Imagine how great it could be if they just loosened some silly policies?

Good burgers are a dime a dozen in the heartland - and that's coming from a vegetarian. Can't say the burgers here are any better or worse than your average upscale burger joint. What does set this place apart from the others is the beer list, rootbeer (on tap) floats, and milkshakes. Yum, yum, and yum. Oh, and they have Symon's claim to fame restaurant's (Lola's) gold star fries, which are a must-have.

The ambiance is nice on the inside of the restaurant - low-key resto-bar vibe. The outside choices give you a view of the parking lot or the mall. Nothing like really feeling like you're in the 'burbs while eating. Not bad if you're just planning to grab a quick beer and burger so you're not starving before starting your grocery shopping at Trader Joe's. But, if you want a nicer meal, try Paladar or the Lebanese place down the road."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "7QHcr_Z2nNGaejvctp_u3Q", "type": "red", "rv": "I used to love a good burger at Bspot. However, it has now started to feel like a basic chain restaurant. 

Two of the five burgers at our table had to be sent back to the kitchen because they were way over cooked. Not to mention the kids mini burgers which were well well done--essentially charred black. .  When they were brought back, all of the fries and sides were gone and the manager made us cut open the burgers to check if it looked ok. Don't they know how to cook medium rare?! 

Once I started eating it again I thought something tasted weird. They gave me a different type of burger. After scraping off the pulled pork I didn't order, I ate a mediocre burger. 

I didn't want to wait again! Especially since our 30 minute wait for the table was actually over an hour! Our server never checked on us until I managed to get enough to eat. 

Even after we told her about the wrong burger, there was no adjustment to the bill and no apology. Bad customer service, weak food, new plastic coated menu...., what happened to the chic burger joint? 

So sad.

The pickle bar is great, especially the Tony Packo's sweet and spicy ones ( seriously... try them.) The Lola fries are awesome, they are thinly sliced fries, sprinkled with rosemary and sea salt. If you don't have them when you go you have completely missed out on the B-Spot experience. This place is really good for kids, however the fact that they don't take reservations or let parts of the group come in at different times I can see would be really frustrating.

Michael Symon's burger place is a decent option if you are in the area.  The burger patties themselves taste pretty good, and the burger meat is cooked very well.  The Lola burger is a very typical burger to order, and the fried egg is a nice touch.  

That being said, last time I went to B Spot I decided to try something different, and got the Porky.  The burger was awfully dry and tasted like sandpaper.

Overall, disappointing. My dad and I were looking forward to some gourmet, delicious burgers. I expected more. Also, I saw the bartender making drinks and he looked lost. He was throwing ice into the glasses and missing. The drinks were only half full. I bet they were $10 drinks and they barely had any liquid in them. Also the fries were nothing special, about Steak 'n Shake quality or less."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "a1x5xhZ2zpBdOfqtH9x-Kg", "type": "red", "rv": "I love Lola's.  I love Lolita's.  I do not love The B Spot, and that admission is so painful it has to be hauled out of me by steel hooks. 

For those of you who don't get the connection, all those three restaurants are owned by local Iron Chef Michael Symon, and two of them are golden. Lola's and Lolita's are as good as it gets in Cleveland.  So when Michael said, I want to put the same care and attention to detail into casual, dining food and opened up a burger joint, I couldn't wait to go.  

At first, everything looks good - a little snooty, but fine.  The burgers are made the way Michael wants them, which means you can't add ingredients, only take them off.  And there is a list of several rules you must follow when you're here: fine, fine, as long as I get the tasty burgers. 

Except they weren't tasty.  

They were really dry, hardly tasting of beef at all.  Mine was slightly moister than my friends, until I realized that having a burger with an egg on top of it was imparting a moistness that other burgers didn't have.  There were, admittedly, a bunch of tangy (and tasty!) sauces that you could put onto your burger to improve the flavor, but the underlying taste was still leathery.  

The shakes were, well, shakes - I had the apple-bacon milkshake, which wasn't bad (the little flecks of bacon didn't particularly improve or detract from the apple flavor), but it wasn't anything I couldn't get straight from Mitchell's.  

The Lola fries were, as always, amazing.  But I can go to Lola for that.  And should.  

Is it a bad place?  No, not really - except that on a weekend, you're going to wait for an hour to two hours to get into this hot spot, AND pay about $2 over the cost of a normal sit-down burger to have this.  Is all that cost, expense, and rule-finding worth it?  Heck no.  

Like Fox Mulder, I wanted to believe.  But in the end, I felt like I was filling out my taxes: a lot of rules, a lot of waiting, and all for not much of a payoff.  Disappointing.  

(P.S. - Could just be that I caught them at the wrong time, but the bathroom was also festooned with toilet paper.  Not appetizing.)"},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "A20V8_FDfKS1srIxLTrOpg", "type": "red", "rv": "We love B Spot.

I work in the same mall as B-spot, and several of us decided to get carry out for lunch one day.  The menu selections read great, and all sound delicious, but the execution in a word SUCKS.  I would at least expect hand pattied burgers with maybe a little seasoning in them, instead it looked like a cookie cutter hockey puck that Applebees would be serving.  Unless Michael Simon only put a B effort into this joint, he shouldn't be proud of this at all.  My burger lacked any seasoning on it at all, and the french fries were packed in a styrofoam cup so by the time we walked all 100 yards back to work, they were closer to steamed unmashed potatoes.  Have to admit the flavor on the two I ate was indeed great, but working in a restaurant for years, you have to put some effort into your togo food as well.  We didn't go for a half hour car ride, it was in the same mall, and the burgers and fries all seemed like they had no love.  I think that if he went to his own restaurant and ordered a burger and reviewed it like he does as a critic, he would tell this place to keep the menu, and get someone who actually cares in the kitchen.  PS your an iron chef, get some wild game burgers, think inside the bun, outsid ethe box a little more, anyone sould slap bacon, italian meats, cheese, and heavenly pig on a mediocre burger.

Occupying the old Cold Stone Creamery building, B Spot is located in the Eton Shopping Plaza on Chagrin Blvd.

A few things stood out to me as I browsed the decor: the open kitchen, a chandelier made of antlers, and a the wall of classic beer cans stacked in an abstract pointillism kind of way to form a giant red B. Funky, casual, yet unique. 

The open kitchen seems to be a common trend for Symon's restaurants. It as if he's saying he has nothing to hide. Similarly, and in the growing trend of food awareness, the menu openly states that we proudly serve naturally raised beef from Pat La Frieda. La Frieda, is a family-run meat purveyor in NYC. Further research revealed that B Spot uses a custom blend of 40 percent chuck, 40 percent sirloin and 20 percent brisket. Your cardiologist may not approve, but at least knowing the beef is bought from a trusted source, the likelihood in contracting e-coli is much less! 

As you'll quickly notice on the menu, the B in B Spot stands for beer, bar snacks, big salads, bad ass shakes, burgers, bratwurst and bologna. There's no denying Symon's bias towards meat and one menu item even pokes fun of our herbivore friends. The Veggie Burger is humorously titled: Why?? and offers to add bacon...free of charge!!

It's obvious Symon stayed focused on all the B's in this menu. There's nearly 40 varieties of beers to chose from, mostly craft brews. There's 16 different burgers, 5 separate bratwurst variations and 6 big salads to chose from. 

To start, we just couldn't resist the $5 Shakes. In 1994 when Pulp Fiction was released, Vincent Vega would've thought we were crazy for spending as much on a shake. In 2009, I'd soon learn that $5 is an absolute steal for this Bad Ass Shake! I settled on the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow Shake and my confidant the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Shake. Yes, mark that down for yet another new use for bacon! At first I found it a bit odd to be chewing a milk shake, but it surprisingly works. 

As a side, we couldn't pass up a few orders of Lola Fries. Cooked in lard and seasoned with sea salt and rosemary, these shoestring fires are very tasty. 

For dinner, we got two burgers and pretty much shared as it was just too impossible to settle on just one burger. We got the Philly Wit, which was topped with flipsteak, cheese whiz & onions. The second burger was the Red Hot which was topped with with pulled pork, pickled tomato, hot peppers, pepperjack cheese & siracha mayo. Not unbearably hot, just the right amount of heat and plenty satisfying. 

Overall the food and service was very good for what B Spot is. Especially considering they just opened a week or so ago. In it's early going and Symon's ever growing local Celebrity Chef status, expect a wait. We arrived on a Tuesday around 7:30pm and still had to wait 45 minutes. B Spot doesn't take reservations either, so be patient. Trust me, it's worth it."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "aW2GmH0UZPvjpex1abJFvw", "type": "red", "rv": "Having deeply enjoyed Michael Symon's other restaurants, I anticipated a night at B Spot would be one of the best burgers I've tasted.  Unfortunately, even ignoring the cachet of Symon, this was one of the most mediocre burgers I've ever eaten.  

I had the bacon cheeseburger, without cheese, and requested that it be cooked medium.  Of the four burgers ordered by our party, three were overcooked.  The only one that wasn't overcooked was the one which was requested to be well-done; that one was undercooked.  

I anticipated biting into a juicy burger of high-quality meat with plenty of beefy flavor.  Instead, the burger was dry and flavorless.  Dousing it with the house's delicious balsamic steak sauce rendered it barely edible, but still without any meat flavor.  My husband and one friend had the Lola Burger and reported that it tasted better in the middle, when the fried egg lent moistness to the burger.  Alas, I did not have that addition.  Even the bacon's flavor was flat - a real shock in a Michael Symon restaurant.

Our friend's daughter had a bratwurst, which was also dry and stiff.  The chicken wings were good and juicy, though, and the Lola fries are a real treat as always.  The milk shakes were reportedly tasty, though one of them had to be remade because it contained banana even after the waiter was specifically and repeatedly asked to omit it.

This was another problem; the service was adequate but not terribly attentive.  We were not offered refills on water or drinks.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table, my friends and I couldn't carry on a conversation because the music was far louder than necessary.

I don't have any plans on returning to B Spot, but it wasn't bad enough that I would refuse to eat there if friends wanted to, and if there was no wait.  Otherwise, it's not an experience I care to repeat.  If I ever end up there again, I will have Lola fries and wings.

Our standard for burgers is pretty high.  We've been to Michael Symon's other restaurants and think very highly of his cooking so we expected greatness.  All in all, it delivered.

I had the brueben (a burger topped w/ a rueben sandwich), my girlfriend had the thin lizzy (topped w/ housemade pickles, mayo, cheddar and grilled onions), my Mom had the fat doug (topped w/ a pastrami sandwich) and my Dad had the standard bacon cheeseburger.  All were delicious.  Burgers cooked to order on point, though we all got medium.  Perfect amount of pinkness.  Toppings were well thought out and high quality - the onions were grilled to golden brown, the bacon was crispy.  

Oh, and did I mention the pickle bar?  I consider myself a pickle connoisseur.  The dills were great as were the banana peppers.  Bread and butter aren't my thing, but great compared to the jarred ones.  

Also, the sauces were a fun and interesting touch. 6 in all, from hot pepper sauce to coffee bbq to lola ketchup to balsamic steak and the standard ketchup and stadium mustard.  They were great as burger dippers.  Also nice to douse on the seasoned lola fries and onion rings.  

Michael Symon knows what he's doing when it comes to burgers.  It's no Kuma's Corner in Chicago, but definitely a top 5 burger in all I've had.

The pattie was pretty unique and had quinoa in it, unlike many patties that are black bean based. I think the fried egg was a really great touch to the burger because it may have been slightly dry without it. I loved that I could add anything from the pickle bar to my burger, so I spiced up the burger with some pickled red onions and jalapenos. Overall- great flavors.

The rosemary fries are DIVINE and still to this day, I long for them! 

The only thing that prevented me from giving them 5 stars is the size of their burgers. They are so good but they are a bit small (at least to me) to warrant a $6-$10 price tag on them. A little pricey in my eyes and I would expect a bit of weight into the burger for that or maybe a generous helping of the side dishes but no.

But besides that, the service is wonderful, prompt and welcoming.

We were in Beachwood Ohio one Saturday afternoon and decided to hop over to nearby Woodmere, Ohio to check out B Spot.

I had the New Jack City burger which comes with chorizo sausage, avocado, salsa verde, roasted red peppers, red onion and pepperjack cheese. It was simply spectacular! My wife had the Fat Doug burger which comes with coleslaw, pastrami, Swiss cheese and mustard. She loved hers also. Our daughter had the Bacon Cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon and your choice of cheese. She loved hers as well. We eventually each passed our burgers around to get a bite of the different burgers and to sample what each other got. The quality of not only the meat but, also the ingredients in the burgers make them worth the $9.00 price tag. There is a free pepper and olive bar in the middle out the room to add some zing to your meal if you so desire.

We also got a order of chili cheese fries which are a la carte but were big enough for the three of us to share. For drinks my wife and I got Arnold Palmers (1/2 tea and 1/2 lemonade) and our daughter got pop. FYI, they charge for refills on the teas at least.

Our server Kelly S was very good as she took good care of us. This location is in a small upscale shopping mall so if there is a wait you can window shop while you wait.

Michael should and would be ashamed of how his business is being run. To start, there was for what ever reason a 1 and 1/2 wait, why? For a burger? None of the pagers were being handled out however your name and phone number were put on a scrap piece of paper- for a phone call that never came,however my name was marked off the list. I was told that she called and left me a VM. Well I was expecting a call from them so I of course was prepared with ringer on high etc. So when No call, I returned and she said with an attidude that she called me and left me a VM,ahh! No!, you didn't!!! She told me it would be an additional 15 min. where I was so upset! Are you kidding?, I saw empty tables!!! At this point I'm ready to leave, but my wife made me stay since we've waited this long, so we reluctently stayed.A few minutes later the same girl came to me and said a table was being cleaned, wet I might add, Dry the tables!!!

So after 1 hr 45 min. we were seated. We ordered the Loya and a veggie burger,onion rings , fries and a high priced  choc. milk shake. I expected to be wowed by all this since after such a wait the food MUST  be fantastic. .right?  .Well the milk shake was good, the Loya burger was nothing to write about, kinda blah, the onion rings were over cooked by a bit, and the rosemary fries were flavorless and cold and couldn't taste any rosemary on them at all. The worst thing was their sad attempt to please the non-meat eaters with a soggy, char grilled flavored veggie burger- oh it was the worst I've ever tasted- Nasty!!!,so,so sad for a Iron Chef to put his name on that ...I'm no Iron Chef buy I can a better one, sorry:( .We expected so much more, but we were very disappionted, we will NEVER come back. 
 
The only thing that made the 40 min. drive o.k. was the time spent waiting being spent at Trader Joes and Barnes and Noble. One last point was the staff of many,in  which it was so hard to tell the staff from who the manager might be. I would  have liked to tell the manager all my disapointments. We found out at the bill, the manager  was aware of our long wait and was adjusting the bill,which took off  the fries ,1 shake,I bought 2@ 5.99, and the onion rings however made no attempt to come over herself to apologize. If you want a decent mike shake for $6 and want to wait as long or longer than a ride at Disneyland, by all means enjoy!!

Well, that's not news since his Fat Doug burger was voted #1 burger in the country, even beating out the likes of Bobby Flay.  I can attest it was the best burger in my tummy, too!

The burger was cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, bursting with flavorful beef, topped with a pile of pastrami, oozing melted Swiss cheese, and crisp crunchy coleslaw.  BIG burger!  Added a side of Lola fries which are fried in lard - who knew what lard does for fries?!  I didn't, but it will be hard to find a better fry....dusted with sea salt and rosemary...mmmmmm.  

Oh!  How did I forget?!  I started the meal with one of the best Bloody Marys anywhere!  This is one original B Mary....even has homemade Lola ketchup in it...don't turn up your nose, you...try it and you'll be a believer, too.  Of course, Lola ketchup bears no resemblance to my beloved Heinz....and I thought I'd never love another ketchup but Heinz....until now....sorry hometown Heinz, you'd love it too.  In fact, my dining companion liked my B Mary so much she ordered one for our next round.

The atmosphere is casual, even has a pickle bar in the middle to help yourself to some interesting extra toppings like sweet hot pickles, hot peppers, etc.....remember going to Roy Rogers and their fixins bar?  Yup...the gourmet version....very cool, fun little extra.

The one thing that I did not like is that you could not change their specialty burgers in anyway (add or remove an ingredient). Not really surprised by this based on the owner...In the end I built my own burger w/ beef patty medium, provolone cheese, grilled onions, peppers, cilantro,  Sriracha mayo, and fries.

The burger was cooked right to medium and tasted good, but there was very little of the additional ingredients I ordered. The Sriracha mayo was delicious and the fries were alright. Overall did the job as I don't typically go out for hamburgers.

Well, to begin with, we asked to be seated inside as it looked like rain - and we ended up at a table in the MALL.  Yes, it was adjacent to the restaurant, but seriously, it had all the atmosphere of a food court.  Wait staff was quick to take our order, and the key thing here is to remember that arriving between 3 and 6pm (happy hour) means all burgers are $5 (except the make your own burger!).  Considering that they were pretty busy, the food came out quickly, but missing one order of Lola fries (shoestring fries with rosemary).  I'm not a fan of rosemary, so personally I think they would have been awesome without it, but for me they were just okay.  My son got the onion rings which were really good - next time I'm ordering those.

My big issue started here.  First, in the menu it was Don't forget the pickle bar! and the wait staff was all don't forget the pickle bar! so I wanted to try it.  I get up and walk back into the restaurant and had to stand there for quite some time before I could even find it.  We are talking a dinky little food service cart that held 8 little crocks (and it wasn't even 8 different types of pickles, some were duplicates).  On top of that the cart was right up against tables and I couldn't even get to one side of it without seriously disrupting people who were eating.  And the selection?  Pickled onions, pickled peppers, banana peppers, sweet pickle chips and garlic dill pickle chips.  That's it.  Really sad.

Back at the table, my son was eating his Atomic Burger - ghost chili pepper, jalapeno peppers, habanero sauce, and pepperjack cheese.  After just a few bites he had drained his soft drink.  After searching around for our waiter, and having to flag him down to ask for a refill, we then waited, and waited, then watched him bring a nearby table a glass of wine.  THEN he had the nerve to walk up to our table empty handed and ask if he could get us anything!  Seriously, if you know that someone at one of your tables ordered this burger, a refill should have come out with the order!

End of the day, meal was okay, glad I got it so cheap as I would have been upset if we had had to pay full price.  Will I go back?

I'll address the food first as I'd hope folks are coming for that and not because it's part of the Michael Symon cult of personality.  Having come from Chicago where they do some amazing burgers (Kuma's anyone?), perhaps my expectations were a bit high.  Honestly though, the burgers at a place like Rally's are WAY better than here.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium and it was about as dry and tasteless as something that'd been sitting under the heat lamps at a turnpike rest stop restaurant.  From reading other reviews, the inability to cook a burger correctly seems to be a pervasive issue.  

   Also ordered the Lola fries since they sounded delicious on the menu, but a big 'meh' there as well.  Oh, one other thing, their website acknowledges everything is cooked in lard, but it's not mentioned anywhere on their actual menus at the restaurant.  Not a problem for me, but if I hadn't checked ahead of time and then re-confirmed with the waitstaff, my vegetarian wife would've been severely disturbed to say the least.  Not that a vegetarian would make this place a destination, but they could be dragged along as part of a bigger group like she was.

  They plop down a cart of sauces to throw on your burger or dip with your fries, but nothing exceptional there.  The manner in which the waitress presented everything on the table ties into another distasteful problem reflected in other reviews, the whole 'you're lucky to even be sitting here' mentality.

          THE GOOD:
What's not to like?? the atmosphere is great. The menu is actually pretty diverse. The Drink selections is great, with tons of awesome beers on draft, and the milkshakes are perhaps the highlight of every visit...... Whoever decided to create a vanilla bean/ apple pie/bacon milkshake is a God amongst men. it is amazing. 
          THE DOWNSIDES:
There are a few things I would change.... The beer selection is great but a one who much prefers draft beers all the beers are listed together on the menu cans/bottles/draft. So sometimes I find a beer I love only to discover its in a bottle and not on draft. The only other drawback might be that they ask you to place your entire order at once. We played by the rules and started our meal off with milkshakes. Great shakes, but I would have preferred to make the Bad Ass shake a desert. I'm hoping that if we had asked that they would have held the shakes off, but we didn't, the server didn't say anything about it and thats how the order came out.
          At the end of the day, I will be going back time and time again. B-Spot is a great place to grab drinks, dinner with friends, or even a casual date spot.

Apparently the recipe has changed because this pulled pork was as flavorless as a Bud Light. I sent it back and asked for my old favorite the Chick Magnet instead.  Also flavorless.  Did someone suck all of the flavor out of B Spot?

Our one saving grace was the Chopped Salad which wad topped with ham, salami, and provolone. I can't give the chefs any credit here...those ingredients don't need any special flair. Oh, and the St. Louis Frambois was also good.

I also think their 'special' burgers (such as the Porky that contains a burger and pulled pork and Coleslaw) are pretty amazing.  I happened to get their seasonal pumpkin pie shake, that I asked if they would make less sweet, and it turned out huge and tasty - and truly made out of pumpkin pie with vanilla ice cream.

I do remember coming the first time a few years ago and being blown away as well - although the burgers are huge and I can barely fit it in my mouth.

This is similar to another upscale, burger joint (Flipside) in Hudson that I happen to love.

We stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner on a weekday and found no problems getting a seat or service.
Loved the variety of burgers and toppings. Went for a bologna and burger combo, while my dining companion had the Lola burger, topped with a fried egg. At 1/3 pound of patty and tons of toppings, these burgers were generous without being so large you couldn't eat them in one sitting.
The Lola fries at the happy hour price of $1 were a real steal. We loved these rosemary-seasoned fries.
Our meals arrived hot and quickly, and we had a great server.
Two burgers, two orders of fries, a beer, a coffee and a 20-percent tip set us back less than $25, and the meal was more than enough that we didn't need anything else to eat the rest of the night.
Be sure to check out the small condiment bar, which had several varieties of local and regional pickles to top your burgers.

Their burgers have won national awards, according to the waitress.  Burger names are just as exotic as the ingredients.  The burger I got was simply called Yo! (yes, the exclamation mark was part of  the name).  It had banana peppers, colla, salami, a hot spread that wasn't really that hot, and - obviously - a burger.  The burger itself was on the small and expensive side, and sides are extra.  If you don't mind dying and going to heaven, get the onion rings.  That was not a figure of speech. 

I really wanted to give this place a fifth star, but I found some flaws. The waitresses seemed as devoted to socializing with other employees as they were about doing a good job at their job(s), which is both good and bad.  I always thought good servers got to know their customers in the same way a stripper gets to know hers before a VIP dance.  That did not happen with me.  The full bar made me very happy, though.  It would be a good place to meet up for a Yelp Elite meeting or something *hint hint*.  For a burger joint, the bar is large like Rosie O'Donnell's waistline.  Yes, that was a fat joke.  I didn't have any major problems since I'm not that picky and I was by myself, so I can't comment on the poor customer service that others received.

I couldn't believe it when I saw they sell my FAVORITE cheap old school beer, Genesee Cream Ale for $2 (which is hard to find in Pittsburgh).  

Michael Symon is my food soul mate with his self-described meat-centric cooking.  B-spot is definitely not for the faint-hearted or veggie-inclined (although a vegeterian friend of mine liked this place quite a bit)."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "I-9NGreE7NlRyG3f8DXslw", "type": "red", "rv": "I'm not getting it!  

We went there during the first month or so that they opened.  It was very meh which, as I understand it, is contemporary-speak for nothing special.  The burger itself, was fully underwhelming.  I mean it's a piece of molded ground beef that's been cooked; so?  Yes there are a variety of toppings so it's kind of like the Melt or even Panini concept insofar as burger themes.  The difference, you don't get to change anything.  Don't like a certain type of cheese?  Tough.  Want a certain sauce from one burger on another?  Tough.  Want to pay a reasonable price for a small piece of meat on a factory-produced bun? Tough.  That's right, the chef known for in-house produced delights like his charcuterie served at Lola and Lolita has the buns mass-produced.  I can only assume this includes the fries.

The meat?  Bland.  No magic there at all.  Just to see if B-spot had improved since years ago, my wife coaxed me into a B-spot burger this weekend and the meat was essentially a bland hockey puck (though smaller to be sure).  In fact, I sort of found the B-spot theme amusing as I thought that the meat would have choked down better with a side order of K-Y jelly to help it actually pass down my throat.  Yes.  That dry.  I had no choice on doneness as I ordered it at the Q during a game.  

The raving about the fries?  I don't get that either.  Yes, the rosemary fries served at the flagship restaurant (Lola) are awesome - a fair accompaniment for any quality meat.  The fries at B-spot are certainly not made in-house.  They are bland and rosemary-less (a word?).  They are very reminiscent of DairyQueen fries.  The fries my kids get at Wendy's lately are far superior.  

And, I guess that's an important point.  A meal at B-spot is not cheap.  Our two burgers, fries and two light beers at the Q this weekend was $37.  The burgers at the non-Q locations aren't much cheaper as a typical burger is $9 without fries.  While this may be an perceived as an ignorrant comment; the burgers at Red Robin are far superior to B-spot's AND, I can customize the ingredients, AND they come with fries AND I don't feel like I've ordered from the Kremlin drive-through with Joseph Stalin on the spatula telling YOU how you want it.  

I have to say I was in awe with Michael Symon's restaurant approach when I first went to now-Lolita many years ago.  The tastes, the care in preparation, the attentiveness  to food and service were wonderful.  Now, B-spot to me, is a personification of Michael Symon's newfound largess courtesy of the Food Network.  It seems his primary interest is in becoming a corporation rather than a purveryor of fine dining.  He is certainly trying to go in the direction of the likes of Wolfgang Puck or  Emeril Lagasse.  That's too bad because as it stands; B-spot would not survive in any city other that Cleveland.  I suspect in Cleveland there is a sort of devoutness to someone who began their career here and continues to evolve here.  In a competitive market like Chicago, New York not a chance.  The burgers are mediocre at best, the fries are very uniteresting, the rules are inane, and the prices are outlandish.  Indeed, $13 for a burger with fries?  Really?

I've lived in New Orleans, an historic city that prides itself on its longstanding and innovative culinary prowess, and while not many restaurants can come close to being on par with the New Orleans food scene, no New Orleans chef could ever even dream of cooking something as titillating as one of Michael Symon's creations. The man is a genius.

Indeed, this is neither Lola nor Lolita. But for what it is, a hip, chic, and laid back burger and beer bar-grille, this place is amazing. There are many good beers -- and even better burgers. From the standard cheeseburger, to one of the nifty specialty burgers, you can count on B Spot to satiate your beef cravings.

First, the burgers are delicious and if you order them done a specific way, you can be sure you'll get it done to perfection. On the same token, I'm a bit disappointed that the whole this is how you get it and suck it up campaign is over. I believe in juicy pink burgers and that was the way they were all served back in the day. Obviously, I'll still order mine pink, but the novelty of this place has been dulled by the loss of that rule. I love the Thin Lizzy, but the YO! is even more amazing if you're feeling a crazier burger. Second, the fries. They're thin, seasoned and a perfect little snack to go along with your burger. Come here hungry so you can have both! 

The happy hour. Oh, gosh, the happy hour. I once spent $13 on 2 beers, a burger and fries--and they were all delicious, not bottom rung frozen, then cooked to tastelessness foods or cheap-o college beers. I'd recommend this happy hour to everyone. There's no reason not to give B Spot a try with these kinds of deals to snag. 

Major disappointment: the pickle bar. I'm pickle crazed and see so much more potential here. 

The service has always been good and everyone seems pleasant when I come here.

Its like eating crab cakes from Obricky's in Baltimore in the city of Philadelphia.  Just not the same.  The Sliders were $2 each and well worth it for the half size burgers. Ordered the trifecta slider triange (I got three of them).  Got home made chips with it which I was not expecting.   Then I was pleasantly surprised by the pickle bar which had Tony Packo's sweet dill, green tomato pickles, and other toppings that made you want to try one of each.  The sauces were great and unique: Coffee BBQ sauce, Shasha sauce (banana pepper), and balsamic steak sauce. The balsamic steak sauce container kept on jamming at the tip due to whatever was in it creating a dam for the flowing greatness seeking its meat destination partner.  But as all dams that break, it gushed out.  I was lucky it didn't splatter all over my suit.  I would have released the Kracken on someone there if it did.

I had ordered the French onion burger.  It was tasteless.  The only favorable thing I can say about this burger is that it's temp was spot on.  How can a burger with gruyere cheese and carmelized onions be tasteless?  As I was sitting there eating my $9 burger and sipping on my $3 soda, I was actually thinking about Wendy's.  I haven't been to Wendy's in 10 or more years.  I probably won't eat there either, but the moment I took a bite of that burger...I was contemplating getting up, walking out and supporting a fast food chain.

The worst part of this meal was the fries.  If you go to this place and you are fighting with whether or not you want to pay $4 for fries (nothing comes with your $9 burger...not even homemade chips) ...I highly suggest not going for the fries.  They were such a let down.  Once again, McDonald's or Wendy's fries are better.  Also, the fries came out cold.  Who wants cold fries?  For $4, one would think that you are getting a fantastic and original tasting cup of fries.   Definitely NOT THE CASE!

This place was such a let down that I actually had to get online, immediately, to write a review and save others from making the mistake I had made.  I have not been on yelp for a long time.  This place made me do it.

Despite the snow, B Spot was at a 20 minute wait for a table, although there was a lone stool at the bar where I could partake in the full menu.

I had the Shromage Burger, Lola Fries (the burgers don't come with any sides on their own), and the Tomato Blue Cheese Soup.  It took a while for the bartender to take my order, but after that, service was reasonably quick.  Unfortunately, while I thought that the soup would come out first, I got all three items at the same time, which I believe is a less-than-ideal serving.

The Shromage Burger was very good.  It was cooked right to my medium-well specification.  In addition to the portabella mushroom, blue cheese, and caramelized onions, what really made the burger was the Lola steak sauce.  The Lola Fries were also very good--thin cut and seasoned.  They kind of remind me of the Pomme Frites at db Bistro Moderne but without the stuff to dip the fries in (which could be an idea for the future).  The fries on their own, though, are already excellent. Finally, the Tomato Blue Cheese soup was decent, but nothing incredible.  Actually, I thought it was a little too cheesy--as if I were eating ravioli.

I know the place is upscale without trying to wholly appear so, but I could have done without the brown paper towel-like rolls for napkins.  They remind me a little too much of a paper towel dispenser you'd find in a men's room and...that doesn't really do wonders for the appetite.

The vanilla apple pie bacon milkshake was not good.  There were only 4 small pieces of bacon on top.  Never tasted that again after those little pieces.  The shake appeared to be mostly vanilla and a few small pieces of apple pie crust.  The cook did not mix the shake well enough and when pouring it, it got all over the place and I lost half my shake on the table.  Not cool, but luckily it did not taste good.  I've had better milkshakes from McDonalds.  I did sample someone else's Chocolate shake, and while it was better than mine, I still think fast food joints outdid these.

The side of fries were the pitiful string fries and there weren't that many in their metal container.  Another disappointment.

His name alone does not make me like his restaurants.  Next, I am not a big fan of restaurant burgers.  Why?  Well, most joints make them too big, out of crap meat, cooked incorrectly, on crap bread.  When I do go to a good enough restaurant that probably makes them well, I get a dish that is a little more posh and inventive.  Therefore, I rarely eat burgers out.

All this has changed now that I have found B-Spot.  Burgers are the perfect size.  Not too big, not too small.  Always cooked to specifications (I waver between medium and medium-rare, hubs is a medium-well kinda guy).  The burger combos are inventive, but not crazy-stupid-wacky-nonsensical.  I enjoy trying new things each time I am there.  I LOVE Lola fries.  Admittedly, they have been way too salty the last 2 times I have been there (and I love salty fries).  Their onion rings are great, but aren't they always?  Oh and you know what?  I haven't felt ill after eating here.  It usually happens when I have a greasy burger and fries from a restaurant.

Alcohol - ok, I should have known to add liquor to my milkshakes.  I didn't and I love that I can get that here.  I wish they would go a little heavier on the liquor, though.  Yummy, nonetheless.  They have a well selected bar menu and I am particularly happy with the whiskey selections (and descriptions).

Service is great.  It is quick, efficient, and not snotty.  I expected it to be a little highfalutin, like the some of Eton mall (and patrons), but it isn't.

Price - Yes, it is a little pricer that typical bar fare, but it is worth it.

Atmosphere - it is in a mall.  It isn't fancy. It isn't a dive.  It is a good, busy burger joint.  If you have those expectations, you are good.

Cons: BUSY!  I get around this by going earlier than 6.  If not, I get my name on the list and fit in a little Trader Joe's shopping."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "PrwnAL82LL4Ewt_wJpHWCA", "type": "red", "rv": "A little depressed about moving to Cleveland and a little depressed that they only place the locals could recommend to eat consisted of the cheesecake factory and melting pot (oh PUHLEEESSSEEE), I was pleasantly surprised to reach B spot burgers, on my trip to the Trader Joes next door.

My parents wanted burgers (yes!), so we stopped here once and came back again on their most recent visit. What I love about the food..is that EVERYTHING HAS PULLED PORK ON IT? What??? TWO MEATS?! YES! 

I first got the Red Hot burger. A medium size patty cooked to my medium preference, that was suppose to be spicy with its sriracha mayo. Totally not spicy, but I thought the burger was solid. The next time I went, I got the schroomage. Mmmm. Mushroom. That was pretty solid. I still want to go back and get that Lola though! 

My dad ordered the plain jane....and he said it was alright. If you go here though, definitely order something more unique! My mom got the Mr. Porky. The bratwurst was HUGE. Bratwurst plus pulled pork? For only SIX BUCKS?!! What a steal.

I had no clue who Michael Symon was (dude, I never had cable tv in grad school!) until friends mentioned him, and I later realized, that this place was HIS restaurant! I knew it was too unique. haha.

It's hard to go into a Michael Symon restaurant without high expectations, especially after I'd kept seeing this place hyped on Twitter and by people I know in the area. B Spot didn't live up to those expectations.

Honestly, the whole concept of B Spot confuses me. Gourmet hamburgers? Burgers are one of the few foods even I can make decently well on a charcoal grill in the back yard. I'd expect an iron chef burger to be unbelievably amazing, especially since they're 8-10 bucks a pop (and don't come with fries, chips or anything). 

I ordered the Yo! which was much less spicy than the menu would lead you to believe. Other burgers ordered by my group included a Shroomage and Thin Lizzy. Everyone agreed that the burgers were good. We each got a side of Lola fries (for an extra 3 bucks a pop) that really left a lot to be desired. They are thin fries and hardly the best I've ever had.

The menu is extensive and has a lot of burger options.  I opted for the Gobbler and was really impressed with the juicy level of the turkey burger.

I'll be short and sweet....

Came an hour before a Brown's game kickoff, no waiting but the waitress wanted to put little ole me at a table for 4 by myself, I decided against it and moved over to the bar for a little more atmosphere and to free up a table for them.

Bartender was great, good conversationalist and recommended a really nice beer for me to try (Great Lakes Oktoberfest).  I liked that he was willing to answer my questions about the local beers and alter what he suggested based on what I enjoyed.  Tremendous beer knowledge!  Plus, he knew exactly why Sept. 1st held a special spot in my heart when it comes to local ice cream....Mitchell's pumpkin spice comes out that day, mmmmmm....and then he said to come back in a couple of weeks when some of the pumpkin ales comes out so he could walk me through them, great personal attention!

I got the Yo burger and it was just cooked just right, not overly big which I'm glad for b/c the toppings really fill you up.  Also liked all the condiments on the table, especially their coffee BBQ sauce.

Lola fries were ok, probably wouldn't get them again, may have to try the onion rings next time.

Since I had to get in a couple of hours of studying tonight, I decided to get the chocolate espresso shake for my after-dinner meal!  Thick, great tasting and so much espresso I was practically vibrating on my drive home  ;o)

As someone who works in the field of CT surgery, doing bypasses on people, I fully endorse the excess bacon and fatty, carby goodness of the B Spot, just contact me in about 20 years when you need those coronary arteries taken care of, drop Michael Symon's name and I'll be sure to give you a discount!"},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "RTBWoGAwFnUdUdtQK5QCNQ", "type": "red", "rv": "Amazing burgers, great prices, good location.

We sat at the bar so we were able to be seated immediately.  I ordered a Simple Salad (basically a side salad) and the Thin Lizzy burger (onions, cheddar, pickles, mayo).  It took me forever to decide which burger to order because all of the options sounded so good! The salad was a good little side and the burger itself was delicious.  It was piled high with the toppings yet held together fairly well.  The meat was very good quality-- tender, flavorful and fresh.  The price point seemed pretty reasonable for most items, with burgers ranging from about $6-11 ($11 burger is a double cheeseburger).  Fries, chips, salad, etc. can be ordered a la carte for a few extra dollars.

My only slight complaint is that I did order my burger medium well and it came out bloody and barely warm in the middle, definitely more medium/medium rare.  I didn't want to be a pain in the ass and send it back, and I felt okay about eating it that way because the restaurant specializes in burgers so I am sure the meat was fresh, but I definitely would have preferred it to be at least warm in the middle, which is why I ordered it medium well to begin with.

My wife and I went to B-Spot and took my parents who were in town.  Four of us had burgers, we split two sides four ways, and we consumed at the table a total of three milkshakes and two beers.  The tab was $65.

We'd have spent more at Applebee's, but not had nearly as tasty of food.

If you read my other reviews, you'll find that I tend to be annoyed at how easily people are influenced by the shiny penny that is everything Michael Symon.  But, in this case, I think people are actually expecting too much and are too easily disappointed.  I don't know... I've heard more bad than good about B-Spot, not just here but in casual conversation, and I disagree.  Why?

My only disappointment came from the lack of size on the burger patty.  I expected 10+ ounces.  I got a very average sized burger.  And the flavor of the meat was nothing spectacular.  I mean, this is La Frieda ground beef, here... but I could do as well at Heinen's.

What made B-Spot a 4-star experience in my opinion was the composition of ingredients on the bun.  I had the Lola Burger, and the combination of bacon, fried egg, and mayonnaise was like getting hit in the face by a baseball bat of creamy richness.  But the pickled red onions cut right through that like a knife.  Oh, it was good!!!

I couldn't help but to think about Anthony Bourdain saying to that guy in that bar, I mean, it's a fucking BURGER!  But seriously, the juxtaposition of creaminess and acidity... oh, alright... I shouldn't use the word juxtaposition when describing a cheeseburger.  It was great.  It was a great combination of stuff.  There.

The Lola fries are overrated, same as they are at Lola.  The onion rings were very good, but aren't onion rings kind of a matter of opinion?

My burger had a composition of flavors and textures that was a home run.  My milkshake was one of the best I've ever had.  The beer selection and atmostphere worked for me.  The location is kind of lame.

Either way, if you're going in for a gourmet burger with toppings you wouldn't have thought of on your own (which are thoughtfully combined, I might add), I think you'll really enjoy it.

If you are going to experience Michael Symon, a self-professed meat lover just putting the biggest patty of ground beef imaginable on a buttery bun, then yeah... you'll be disappointed.

Another regular complaint is regarding the no-substitutions rule.  I agree with this rule.  It's a gourmet burger joint.  You don't go into Lola and ask for the ribeye, but instead of salsa verde, maybe a beurre blanc or a mushroom gravy.  Symon is composing unique burgers.  If you aren't into that, you aren't into that!

I attempted to order a simple cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato, american cheese... and grilled onions.  B-Spot has some odd rules; all food must come out together, only complete parties will be seated, and no menu changes may be made.  My request of grilled onions was rejected in a manner so rudely, I refused to offer my patronage to this establishment.  The standard cheeseburger order comes with lettuce, tomato, and raw onion; the waitress refused to allow my request of grilled onion.  I offered to order another item on the menu; which had lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and cheddar cheese - I was not allowed to sub out cheddar cheese in preference of American.  

When I told the waitress my request, she acted as if I was ignorant - stating that Michael has spent a great deal of time creating the best possible combinations for his menu, and since he knows best, that is the way it will be best.  Nevermind the minute differences and compromises of my order - Michael knows best.  Upon telling the waitress I would not eat at a restaurant with such poor customer regard, she continued to try to belittle me with a smug attitude while my friend followed through with his order.  

B-Spot is not a place I would recommend to any true burger fan, even before this sour encounter.  The approach is pretentious, the staff is arrogant (and overweight/putzy), and the food is average at best.  I have been to Symon's other restaurants (Lola, Lolita) and they do not live up to the hype with their limited menus and forced atmosphere.  I have been to world class restaurants, nationally recognized burger joints (Thurman's in Columbus, anyone?), and everywhere inbetween; B-Spot is forgettable.  The attitude and atmosphere of the restaurant further diminish the experience.  

If you want a true gourmet burger, go to Moxie.  If you want a good greasy burger go to Five Guys or Fatburger."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "T76-jKiHe5Fz5qTjQQlWoA", "type": "blue", "rv": "Well reviews are all over the place for this place!

We were unable to finish the rings.when I did not take them home,she looked at me funny   The burger was cooked perfectly pink. The meat was very fresh and had that perfect fat to meat ratio.  The rings were quite tasty. I actually prefer things to be cooked in peanut oil.  I really can not think of a place that does burgers better than this.  The pickle bar is an added bonus.

Ok, I get it Happy Hour is for cheapskates like myself but even I won't eat mediocre food. Went to the B Spot this evening and was terribly disappointed. I use to love their full size burger Happy Hour but Michael Simon has given up on that and that's a shame. Not only for the patrons but for the servers as well. Since I doubt Mr. Simon pays them a living wage an almost empty room is not going to line their pockets with cash.  When the Happy a Hour included most of the big burgers the place was packed and if customers were like me the tips were a little fatter given the meal was so cheap. 
Instead now they have gone to sliders. Ok...sliders.  Even though they might be cheaper to produce, they should be good sliders.  The sliders I had there tonight were horrible.  So horrible that if I were Mr. Simon I would not want my name associated with them.  
Where do I begin?  For starts they were barely room temperature. They only cook them one way...way done. The cheese on them was congealed and the buns stale.  They lacked any moistness whatsoever in meat, cheese or bun.  Quite frankly I've had better at White Castle.  I assume Mr. Simon has no clue what the kitchen is up to because I can't believe any of this is ok with him.  I get that he is busy and all but if I were a chef of Simon's notoriety I would not want to be associated in any way to such mediocrity. 
I want to add that the French fries were cold. Not the least warm but cold.  How does a Michael Simon kitchen screw up the basic faire of a fifth rate, hole in the wall lunch counter?  But they did. 
Advice to Mr. Simon: If you don't want to do Happy Hour, well fine. Just stop it altogether.  Don't allow yourself and your name to be associated with subpar food.  
While I'm no chef, I do like to cook myself. I take my preparation of food seriously. I believe Simon does too.

Food:  burger was not cooked to our request.  My well done was rare. It took so long to receive our order, I didn't bother to send back, plus our waitress never came back to check on our food.

The burgers, while tasty, are small and do not come with fries. Do.Not.Come.With.Fries. One of my fellow diners had a brat and decidedly loathed it. Everyone was MEH about the burgers.

I love it so much that I might just HAVE to visit it every time I come home to OH for a visit. Yes it's that good. So good that I hope you come westward to Chicago and open a restaurant. So good that I am salivating just writing this review...

What's so good you ask? Everything. I love the rocker/biker decor. Sure they don't take reservations so if you want to sit in a booth prepare to wait. But why sit in a booth when you can sit in the middle of the room at the bar and chat up your friendly bartender? You have a great view of the room and plenty of space to oogle at your fellow patrons.

The food...ah yes, the food. Well, let's start with the drinks. The milkshakes to be exact. They're divine. I would have to say B Spot rivals Tommy's for the best milkshakes in Cleveland. A bold statement - I know. With flavors like vanilla bean apple pie bacon (they use frozen apple pie and work in the bacon after its been cooked to a crumble) and chocolate espresso you really can't go wrong. Next work your way onto some sea salt and rosemary Lola fries (love the thin frites as opposed to the thicker fries) and you're almost there. You want a salad? OK, fine they have those and they're pretty substantial, but you're crazy if you're not going to B Spot for a burger. At the recommendation of our friendly bartender I ordered the Symon Says complete with bologna. This juicy burger was worthy of the knife and fork that accompanied it.

1.  1 hour wait for a table at a mall on a Sunday for a mediocre burger.

2.  I ordered my burger rare.  To them, this apparently means well-done, because it was waaaaaay overcooked.  My SO's was over-done too.

3.  This restaurant makes it very clear that to them, the kitchen, not the customer, is always right.  So, you may only take items off your burger, not add something on or substitute.  How pretentious and unfriendly.  This place needs to get over itself and realize that different people like different combinations on their burger, and a GOOD restaurant humors those requests.

4.  The bun was bland, gooey, and unappealing.

5.  Everything between the bun (overcooked burger, cheese, bacon, fried egg) was tasteless.  Really tasteless.  Very surprising.  I make much more flavorful, unique burgers at home.

6.  No avocado on any burger???  REALLY?????

7.  I appreciate a fried egg with a gooey center as much as the next girl, but this fried egg had a RAW center that was liquid.  Gross.  If that's the latest hipster foodie trend, count me out.  And unless they offer a warning on the menu about the dangers of eating raw eggs, they shouldn't serve a raw egg.

8.  The waiter acted like he was doing us a favor and was very impatient.  Dude, I waited an hour for this freakin' table.  You can take a moment, breathe, and wait for me to order at a normal pace.

9.  We weren't sitting IN the restaurant, so much as outside of it, and in the mall's center.  Um.  Tacky.  It was like eating in a mall foodcourt.

10.  Here's the most annoying thing about this place (which was overall pretty annoying).  The website actually states, No Whining! We will do our very best to make everyone happy. Just like line jumpers at an amusement park, whiners will be prosecuted & removed from the establishment. Life is short, have fun & enjoy the moment.  Um, dude, your place isn't so special that people can't complain if the food is over/under-cooked, the service stinks, and the burger's tasteless.  No need to intentionally antagonize your customers with stupid rules about how they should act in your MALL RESTAURANT.  Seriously, have some manners, get some class, and remember: The customer is ALWAYS right.  This is how you will stay in business past your 15 min of fame on the Food Network.

I'm tired of celeb chefs opening hipster restaurants that brag and boast about how fabulous their own food is, charge more than they should, have long waits with mediocre to bad service, and the food they produce never measures up to everything advertised.  I'm just tired of it.  

I'm not EVER waiting an hour for a table at a burger joint again.  Really.  I don't care if the burgers come gold-plated and promise to do my laundry.

I really wanted to like this place but each experience solidified that it just isn't the place for me.

I had previously tried the Yo! Burger and Fun Guy which were decent but nothing great compared to other gourmet burger joints I had been to. This time I decided to try the Lola Burger but asked if I could get it without the pickled onions and just regular onions. I also asked if they could add lettuce and tomato.  You'd think for $10.99 this wouldn't be a big deal but the waitress told me they can't make changes to the burgers.  What?! Are you serious? Just don't put the pickled onions on and bring me out some lettuce tomato and onion and I'll put it on myself if it's too difficult for the cook.  Of course I stated this a little more politely but I was thinking this is ridiculous. She said she would have to ask her manager if they could do that.  All I'm saying is that if you offer a build your own burger for $7.99 then anywhere from .49-$1.99 per topping I think you can remove one topping and give me some lettuce, tomato and onion.

Now I've tried the Lola Fries before and wasn't that impressed and they cost me an additional $3.99. I'd be alright with this if they weren't basically frozen shoestring fries with a sprinkling of rosemary.  Something like that should come with the burger.  There was nothing great about these fries imo.  So this time I got the Pork Cracklings which were still $2.99 extra but better than those fries. 

I opted not to get a shake this time but on my previous trip I got a Pumpkin Pie Shake which was the best thing I ever had from B Spot. I'll give them credit there.  Even at $6.99 for a shake, it was worth it I admit.

So the food comes out about 20 minutes later but I never did get an answer about my request. When my food is presented it has the lettuce, tomato and onion on the side and the waitress tells me that her manager was too busy to ask so she just brought it out but that I'd have to take the pickled onions off the burger myself.  Wow!  You are telling me that the cook had to put them on?! What that means to me is that these burgers are pre made and heated up. How on God's green Earth can't you remove a single item. Especially if I'm paying $10.99 for just the burger!  

The Shasha sauce (mustard), Lola Ketchup and Coffee BBQ sauce on the tables are all pretty good stuff. They had a pretty decent craft beer selection which had Three Floyds featured so I grabbed one at a normal bar price.  There is the complimentary pickle bar which is an interesting touch. You can get kimchi, pickled onions, green tomatoes and a few types of pickles including my favorite, Tony Packo pickles!  That was a welcome surprise but not enough to make up for what I didn't like.  

Speaking of, my main complaint is the price you are paying for what you get. To order a burger, fries and shake you are looking at over $20 before tax and tip.  You are paying for the Michael Symon name and that is all. I'd rather pay good money for a meal made by Michael Symon and not some random guy in the back following such a blueprint that they can't take off and item from a burger.  

The burger wasn't bad but smaller than most gourmet burger restaurants. The fries are nothing special and came at an additional cost. Pork Cracklings were decent but again an additional cost. The milkshakes are the real star but come at a premium of $6-$7. The staff hide behind ridiculous rules. Pickle bar was a plus along with the sauces to bolster the tasteless fries.  But ultimately everything was far overpriced and I don't like the attitude towards patrons who are throwing down this kind of money. There are better options at half the price.

Sure, he's got a few rules by which diners must abide. I really wonder if all of the people who have such a bone to pick with the rules board realize that the universe revolves around the sun and not around them.  I also wonder if these people go up to their favorite musicians or actresses and say, You know...your performance was good, but you should do this and that differently to make it better because I didn't like it. Would they go up to George Clooney and tell him, I liked you a lot in Up in the Air, but your performance was a bit lacking in a few ways, you should do this differently, with a know-it-all swagger? Probably not, unless they were a guy whose girl was crushing on him and they were mad at him! I also doubt that they would go up to Slash and say, Y'know, your solo in Sweet Child of Mine wasn't bad, but maybe you should play the ending differently because I didn't like the way it sounds. Hence, those folks shouldn't have the gall to go up to Michael Symon and tell him how to cook his food, because the man is a genius at what he does. There are plenty of places, such as Burger King, that will allow you to have it your way and customize to your heart's content All of you who aren't down with Cleveland's Iron Chef can go there and pick and choose exactly what you want on your dry burger. Let me know how that works out for you!

I've had a variety of items here, and nothing has been less than perfect. Not a thing. The shakes are well worth the money, especially the Vanilla Apple Pie Bacon, which is revolutionary. Spend a few extra bucks and get the hooch put in too! As far as side dishes, the chips are fantastic. I thought that it was a bit much to spend $5.00 on chips at first, but let me tell you, that parmesan fondue that comes with them is delish and we've ordered them every time since then.

Let's talk about the focal point of B Spot: the hamburgers. The Fat Doug has won national burger competition awards; after you have one bite, you'll see why. The Symon Says is my second favorite. My wife's had the Chilly Willy and the Philly Whit--both of those were also good. The less adventurous should opt for the Thin Lizzy, which is a basic cheeseburger with some fun toppings. They do have a veggie burger as well. 

I've never had the bratwurst--maybe someday! I just can't bear to pass up those great burgers...but I do love me a meaty brat. B Spot also has chicken and salads, I've never had those, and honestly, I never plan to do so. I am glad to eat quasi-healthily throughout the rest of the week if it means that I can eat whatever I want at B Spot! 

The wait can be a little long on weekends, especially when cold weather closes down the patio area and there is less seating. Fortunately, B Spot is located right next to Barnes and Noble, Anthropologie, Trader Joe's, and many other stores...so put your name in, do some shopping, and relax for a bit at Barnes and Noble with all of those magazines that you need to catch up on...and you'll be seated before you know it. I am probably the most impatient person on Yelp, and I believe the wait for B Spot is fully worth it.

If you live in Cleveland and you haven't been to B Spot, please do yourself a favor and plan on eating your next meal there. If you don't live in Cleveland, B Spot should be a non-negotiable when you're planning your itinerary.

I had the Bacon Cheesburger with Lola Fries and a beanless meat Chili to go. While the burger was not the best I've ever tasted, it was definitely in the top 25% of the many burgers I have had in my day. The meat was very fresh and not too salty, which IMHO is the key to letting the flavor of the meat come through.

The burger was done to a perfect medium, but was a tad greasy. The bacon was thick and tasty, the onion, tomato and lettuce were fresh and crunchy and the cheddar cheese made the combo whole.

The Lola fries were fried slightly crispy in Peanut Oil and had a subtle salt and rosemary taste, but the shoestring cut required several in hand at one time to get ketchup on them.

My to-go chili was small (it is an appetizer after all) and, like the burger, it was decent but not the best chili I've had. The taste was a little bland, though the dish was deceptively spicy.

Overall, the food was better than average, though not tremendous, and the service was pretty spotty - they screwed up two things on our order. To the positive, the bill was quite reasonable.

My expectations were very high, given Michael Symon's previous ventures and overall reputation, unfortunately my experience came up short. 

First off, I don't understand why they can't bring out the appetizers first. We were starving, but had to wait for all our food to come out together before we could dig in (to be fair, the food did come out promptly). Despite not having to wait for all our food to come out, it was annoying that I felt rushed to eat the appetizer (wings and soup) before my entree cooled off. 

The food was subpar. The wings were fried well, but the parmesan and garlic seasoning was lacking in flavor and was really too buttery for my liking. The bleu cheese and tomato soup was nothing special either (ditto for the fries). As for my entree, I got the yo! burger, which sounded phenomenal on paper, but came out way too dry (I asked for medium well, and it came out very well done). It did have a nice bun, but paying ~$9 for a burger, I expect a burger of more substantial size. Another member of my party got the pulled pork sandwich, which was good but the bun couldn't hold the juiciness of the pork and quickly fell apart. 

To be fair though, they had a phenomenal beer list (although the waiter wasn't well versed in the offerings when I asked for a recommendation, but he might not have been of drinking age either so I can't fault too hard for that) and the pickle bar was a nice addition to the meal."},{"source": "kROYR_6mVfg9WgJ7z1HOSA", "target": "yxbFjvHeX2QrJQ3NJzCkOw", "type": "red", "rv": "After a friendly greeting and 30 minute wait, we were seated. The evening started with a mixup in the milkshake order, with a member of our party receiving the wrong shake, which was then redelivered (half-drunk and without apology by our server) to another member before being determined as a totally unordered shake upon the arrival of our actual shakes. Our shake, ordered with bourbon, was bourbonless. 

The food arrived. My girlfriend's grilled cheese was congealed and not melted. It also lacked any peppers or real flavor, with only a few pieces of lettuce in addition to the cold cheese. My stadium brat was nothing special, slathered in stadium mustard and soggy grilled onions. The brat itself was unsatisfyingly soft and mushy inside. Upon receiving our check, we were charged for the extra shake but the lack of bourbon was addressed in our ordered shake price. When we asked our waitress to correct the bill, she removed the wrong shake so we were charged for the non existant bourbon. Finally, our bills were corrected and we paid, although we had to wait an extended period of time for the to-go boxes after the rest of our party had left. 

My seat was directly under a dripping air vent, which did little to improve the overall experience.

My original review never posted, so I include it here:  A family favorite generally (we are regulars), tonight they had an epic fail.  They served my daughter's special burger complete with the small paper dispensing cup (which had held the burger's cheese sauce) smashed into the bun.  It neither tasted good nor looked too good, even if it offered extra fiber.  And the advertised prosciutto had been substituted with pastrami.

My burger had no extra meat at all, neither prosciutto nor pastrami.

They agreed to comp a burger and a shake, but the bill they delivered was only for the burger and shake - a bill I should have paid:  when I pointed  out the error they gave me another, much higher, bill.

Fries are a la carte but are thin, crispy, and rosemary-seasoned - SO good. 

Smasher's special - different burger every week or so on special. Sean's gotten them a few times and liked it. 

Fat Doug (see above)

Apple pie/bacon/vanilla bean shake - awesomeness. I mean who doesn't love bacon anyway (except Jewish and Muslim peeps...and vegetarians....) Yeah well.....I love bacon and it's a great addition to a sweet shake.

We love the food here and come back a couple of times a month. The only reason B Spot gets 4 stars is that the atmosphere pretty much sucks in my opinion. Although Eton is nice as strip malls go, it's still a mall. There is absolutely nowhere to wait for a table so you have to go walk around the mall. That in itself doesn't really bother me because I am a book slut and we just go into Barnes and Noble next door. 

What I have against the place is that there is sort of an 'indoor patio' type seating area outside of the main area which juts out into the mall. B Spot is trying to be a casual burger joint, which it is. But then the restaurant is open on one side to an upscale mall. It just doesn't work.

Bacon Apple Pie Vanilla Milk Shake.  Score. Yes. And those words might not be in the correct order, but those are the correct ingredients! A+ for creativity and something unexpected, but that works!!! 

PICKLE BAR. I love this because of the sweet & sour pickles (I THINK that's what they were). They are SO GOOD.  There are 3 varieties of pickles to choose from here. It's clever. Different.

B Spot has a very simple, organized menu with a very creative spin on traditional diner fare (ie: that amazing shake). All the burgers, save for the mushroom burger, are basically for meat LOVERS. The burger patty itself becomes a condiment along with the lettuce, tomato, etc. because there is a different kind of meat on each burger, depending on what you pick. Pastrami in your burger, steak in your burger, turkey in your burger, now I'm making up different meats to go in your burger, but it really is something like that! (Prices I think range from $7-11ish? Check the website or call...)

The mushroom burger isn't amazing, but it was still OKAY.  It's just a mushroom cap in your burger. (Go to Lopez in Cleveland Heights for the most amazing mushroom burger).

Fries with cheese whiz and pulled pork ($5, as with the other items in this category). Yay for the fries (the long and skinny type), nay on the cheese whiz...(but it's so unbelievable you start to believe that Michael Symon somehow managed to make cheese whiz good). Pulled pork worked alright with this combination...

CHIPS = pretty impressive for chips. i think they're made in the restaurant, it's like a kettle style chip, but what REALLY matters is that it's served with a parmesan rosemary cheese fondue which is really good.

The salads are HUGE. My roommate looked like she bought greens at a grocery store and dumped the entire bag of it onto a dinner plate.

B Spot it was! 

The burgers and fries were both pretty good, as far as those go; I ordered a standard cheeseburger (The Thin Lizzy) and my husband got their bruschetta burger. Obviously I high-tailed it to the pickle bar and piled my bodyweight in pickles onto my tray, which meant I could only finish about half my burger... 

I did find a hair (or something) in my burger about halfway through, and when we brought it to the server's attention, she fetched the manager who apologized, offered me a new burger (or shake, or whatever I wanted), and when I declined, they took my burger off the check.

Pros: 
The shroomage burger is good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Portebello is thick and very delicious. Onion rings are just average. The outside dining area is amazing.

Has different sauces (coffee ketchup, balsamic steak sauce, etc). Quite good.

I hear the shakes (the one with apple and bacon?) is delicious.


Cons:
B-spot does not allow you to custom-add to your burger (I asked the waiter if they could add an egg to my burger) Why? A little insert on your table says something to the point that the ingredients for every burger on the menu is carefully thought out...blah blah blah. Going with that logic, it is interesting, therefore, that you can take stuff away, but you can't add stuff in.

Group gratuity is automatic 20%. Thats right. 20% for a burger joint that has a help-yourself-to-extra-condiments stand. -_- i thought they wouldn't let you add stuff to your burger...

Overall great food, priced for quality and name brand, but wonderful for someone on a limited schedule.  I waited 7 minutes but was there at 5pm, get early or plan on waiting.  This is true for a few of the restaurants around that area, except for maybe Corky and Lenny's.

The place is heavenly! Their spices and herb blends are so much more aromatic and fresh than the stuff you find in a normal grocery store. If you don't believe me, each spice has a tester (like the candle store). Sniff the flavors until your hearts content! 

Since I discovered Penzy's, I've completely replaced my old spice/dry herb collection. They also have hard to find spices that I haven't been able to find anywhere else (gumbo file, juniper berries, zater, celery seeds, etc.). Even if you're in the market for a simple spice such as curry or paprika, they have multiple variations and flavors. 

Another thing I like about Penzy's is their own mix blend seasonings and rubs (ie. BBQ 3000, Florida Peppered Seasoning, Fox Point, Mural of Flavor, North Woods, Chicago Steak Seasoning, English Prime Rib Rub, Shrimp & Crab Boil, Corned Beef Pickling Spices, etc.). All are amazing. I've tried every one of them! 

If you're already a regular Penzy's freak like me, I do suggest subscribing to their monthly magazine which you can do so free at the store. Oftentimes the magazine comes with a coupon for a free spice of the month. The magazine also features a lot of great recipes that use the exclusive Penzy's blends. 

If you're a foodie like me, you'll understand that using top notch fresh ingredients makes a world of difference in your meal. With Penzy's, we finally have a place that can satisfy the foodie in all of us!"},{"source": "LHrYC3n3nrEHrfVsshtqTg", "target": "ey-4MP3wXg9byW4QFj2_dg", "type": "red", "rv": "specialty stores are hit or miss.  sometimes you wonder if there really is enough demand for a small boutique specializing in swords for renaissance faires.

yes, those types of specialty stores make no sense to me.

but then there are the *other* kind.  if you're an avid cook or baker, hobby-wise or professionally speaking, you should check out penzey's.

they have sections and sections of spices and rubs from all over the world.  three different kinds of cinnamon, several different types of curry, barbeque mixes, and unique mixtures of herbs and spices you won't find anywhere else in cleveland.  

throughout the store there are large jars for you to smell each seasoning.  there are usually different sizes of each item as well, in case you have a gigantic request of dutch chocolate in a chocolate cake recipe.

they can be a tad pricey depending on what you are buying.  i mean, it is a specialty store, and they are spices (which are pricey to begin with).  but penzey's really is a great place for cooks.  they also have a list to sign up for their catalog, which often gives you discounts and deals on their products, and recipes too.  

i really like their hot chocolate mix with a hint of mint.  and the vanilla sugar.  i bake, so with all their baking stuff i have small bursts of contained excitement when i look over the different types of extracts and powders.

overall, i approve of this unique boutique.

On average, some of their spices are more expensive than say a standard brand like McCormick, but they way I see it, their spices are so strong and fresh, they will last much longer than the stale plastic  containers you get on the grocery shelves. Also some spices that are harder to find like whole cardamom, zataar, Spanish saffron are actually cheaper than if you were to buy them online. I also like that they sell small, medium and large sizes of most of their spices, that way if you don't have to be stuck with a huge container of fajita season knowing you won't be able to use it all. 
I can't neglect to mention how awesome their gift box section is; if you know someone who loves to bake or grill, they have customized gift boxes with medleys of spices. I think they make a very personal gift for that someone in your life you know would appreciate good quality spices. 
You can also request their catalog which has coupons and recipes.

If you're looking for celery seed or Sichuan peppercorns and are striking out at Whole Foods, you'll be able to find what you need at Penzey's.

The spices I've purchased at Penzey's are good quality but a bit expensive. I'm continually disappointed that they don't really have anything in the way of organic offerings: while I know it's not always possible to source everything as organic, there's really no excuse for such an upmarket store to not even try.

The store itself is Spartan, and not in a good way: there's little in terms of decoration, with some old burlap bags tacked to the wall and plain wooden shelving. It looks a lot like one of those temporary holiday mall storefronts, where everything has been deliberately kept dull to make it easier to take the whole thing apart again in a few weeks. Again, it's just not what you'd expect for an expensive store in one of the most high-end shopping malls in the city.

My final annoyance with Penzey's is the short hours: they close at 6pm! I often feel the urge to buy some exotic spice after work for that day's dinner, and the early closing time makes it next to impossible.

My friend and I went to this Whole Foods this past Friday and had the worst experience. While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. 

I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. 

After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. 

Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. 

Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. 

It's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. 

Oh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while."},{"source": "NFv21m2Czqz2XM5G4kpbKg", "target": "mZJug5G_my4Tzul4b4DlaQ", "type": "red", "rv": "As a whole, I tend to avoid most of anything on the East Side of the Cuyahoga. It's not that I've got a phobia of going east, or a deep-seated distaste for everything Cedar, Coventry, Legacy and Brainerd. It's just so darn hard to get to anything that's not directly off the high way, it's neigh ridiculous. Waiting five minutes, just so someone with a heart of gold allows you to turn left on Chagrin is a good way to raise the blood pressure through the stratosphere.

Location damnation aside: Whole Foods almost makes the maddening trip on 271 and 480 worthwhile. The produce always smells and looks great, something that my local Giant Eagle can't compete with. I'll pay a few cents more an ounce to get an orange that tastes subtly different than any other orange I've eaten, simply because of where it was picked on the tree, rather than an orange that tastes like every other orange in the bag, only more so. I've not picked a bad head of lettuce or lemon or onion from Whole Foods, and they seem to last almost a few days longer.

Outside of a butcher shop, it would be very difficult to find and match the selection at their meat counter, somewhat hilariously situated next to where the vegan protein replacements are, as if Whole Foods is daring vegans into eating meat again.Once again, I've never gotten a bad cut from them, be it beef, pork or chicken. And, as an added bonus for those of us who simply can't spend 10 minutes dumping ingredients into a bag, they'll marinate your choice of meat for you. There's no premarinated choices for you, like Heinen's. You pick it, they'll do it. Easy peasy, teasy-wheezy sneezy deezy as my son says. 

And then, there are the cafe options. There were pretzels yesterday -- no lie -- the size of my head, the arms as big as my biceps, twisted inward as if they were hugging themselves. There was pizza that looked as though it'd come out of my oven, cheese slightly running off the edges. There were chicken wings and curries and salad bars and soups. Oh, the options, the decisions!

The beer and wine options aren't too shabby either -- I'm not much of a wino (yet) but, there was plenty to interest me. If you're looking for a cheese pairing, take it to the cheese counter and ask. I defy you to do the same at your local Giant Eagle. I'm sure you'll go home with a gallon jug and something Kraft.

While I have nothing bad to say about my experiences (aside from some of the overly-privileged Saab and Volvo driving crowd feeling they're entitled to stand perpendicular to aisles, to ensure that no one gets past them, or scoff when you get into their way, pushing across your body to grab that elusive bag of rice that she just can't wait to put in her cart, while her other hand clutches a Starbucks.

This place sounds nice but its not. In my most recent visit they did away with the white and red table clothes but the its still the same tables, probably the same carpet. They just replaced the old tube tv with a flatscreen the last time I was in there. The food the last time I was in there was greasy. It was most surely not fresh. Just full of grease. Full of grease. Now I have  not been here in a while. One, cause I no longer live there. Two, because it was not good at all. I would only go there to show someone who had not seen the area a local staple. It does not mean the local staple is good. The place never had the best service. In fact the service was long and slow. I barely remember the service because it was something  I want to forget. I just remember it being slow the last time. O yes they serve wine. Out of a small wine fridge they probably bought at walmart. They do have a wine rack. With wine they probably bought from walmart.

Last evening I ordered 3 carryout pizzas for the family (we like well done) and they were perfect. The crust is great, the toppings are generous, and the cheese (provolone) is tasty. On occasion, I'll stay and eat, but can't really comment on table service because I eat at the small bar area. Never have used the delivery service. 

I don't get the reviews that are critical of the decor or demeanor of the owner (Joe). It's a pizza place that serves very good pizza.

We decided to sit on the patio, as it was the perfect weather to enjoy dinner outside. The patio is very spacious and most of the tables are in the shade, which is nice, although there are umbrellas for each table, as well.

The menu is a pretty typical Mediterranean one, with everything from salads to schwarma, and falafel to shish kabobs. Their appetizer list was pretty extensive- it was hard not to order one of everything! Being that the menu had too many good choices (and I was indecisive as usual), my mom and I decided to split the Taste of Taza appetizer platter and a bowl of the nine vegetable soup for our meal.

It seemed like it took awhile for the food to arrive, but some warm pita and dipping oil arrived to wet our appetites. There was also a sweeter tasting bread which was quite addictive. The bowl of soup was pretty good. It was full of vegetables in a hearty tomato broth. Next time, I will have to try the tomato couscous soup!

Our appetizer platter finally arrived and WOW was it big. We were glad we decided to split it! The platter included schwarma, shish tawook (chicken), vegetable couscous, Lebanese salata, hummus, and baba. The schwarma had a distinctive spice that I couldn't quite figure out (cinnamon maybe?), but nonetheless it was really good. I loved the chicken and fought my mom for it. The only thing I didn't really care for was the hummus- it just didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. So I ate the most of the baba instead! It was the perfect dish for the indecisive, and we got to taste a little bit of everything which was awesome. I would definitely order it again!!

Overall, it was a delicious dinner. The prices are more than reasonable for what you would expect at this kind of restaurant. I would definitely recommend coming here when you are in the mood for some Mediterranean...looking forward to going back!"},{"source": "T7weU8D-PrX8tGrAFJOSxw", "target": "4t3poW-vowQfbwuS18xc2A", "type": "red", "rv": "Lovely food and very good service.

I am not one to put much stock into atmosphere (unless it is obnoxiously bad), but the open-air design of Taza works very well. You are not sitting on top of other diners so privacy is not an issue, and when the place is full (which was fairly often), the room takes on a warm, family-type vibe. Outdoor seating is available, too (in season, of course). Everyone from the host to the servers were extremely friendly, and it wasn't long until we had our regular table and server every time we went.

Of course, none of this matters if the food is not up to par, and thankfully it is fantastic. Soups and appetizers are flavorful and generous (I'm not sure how I lived this long without kibbe), and the main dinner entrees offer more than enough food. I was never once let down by either the fresness or quality, and I came here once a week, at a minimum. If you have never tried Lebanese food, you are missing out...a new world of flavor awaits you. Fish, meat, vegetables...you can't lose. Specialty drinks are offered, as well as the normal stuff from the full bar. One downside...the blender at the bar can be a bit noisy, as there is nothing but a few feet of air between it and the tables. A minor quibble but worth pointing out.

As another poster mentioned, you will be thirsty during your meal. The open fire no doubt contributes, and I imagine the spices in the dishes may factor in as well. Thankfully, your glass will never be empty for very long.

Taza will be sorely missed now that I have left Cleveland, and should I ever return to the area, it will be my first stop. You can get Lebanese food cheaper elsewhere, but if you want the full package, this is it."},{"source": "T7weU8D-PrX8tGrAFJOSxw", "target": "7Zc2uM-5bVgqMwIM1mKkmQ", "type": "blue", "rv": "So this place is in the ritzy ditzy area of woodmere.

The food is good and plentiful. They started us off with hot pita bread and zaitnza3tar, a middle eastern delicacy consisting of olive oil mixed with ground oregano, thyme and sesame seeds. Albert Einstien used to eat that, thats why he was so smart.
We ordered the combo appetizers : hummos, falafel, baba ghanouj and what not. I really liked it.The shawarma platter is off the hook. The mix grill is very succulent, tender. And delicious. I would definitely come here again.

He was conversational and fun and even brought us some baklava to apologize for a (pretty short) wait when we were first seated. Really just an all-around great server!

If you want to know about the food and drinks, read Kaitlin D.'s review, because I agree with 99% of what she said. The only things I really have to add are that I loved the entree - it was just better when I avoided the pita chips in it, and that the fries that I remember having at lunch with my mom are yummy too.

The food, while moderately priced, was mediocre at best.  My friend's salad with grilled chicken was terrible.  

Our waiter provided us with inexcusably bad service.  After we were seated he brought menus and water straight away, pressured us to order, and when we said we needed just one minute to decide, he us for at least ten and avoided when we tried to catch his eye across the patio, something that continued to happen throughout the evening.

When I ordered I asked him to clarify the price on the different shish kabobs, I thought I'd chosen one that cost $12.95.  Later when the check arrived, it had magically turned into a dish costing $16.95.  When I politely asked about the price he rudely retorted, no, you're wrong, and looked at me like I was insane for even asking about it.  A simple apology would have been all it took to fix the situation.

We had been to the Eton plaza before, and I see it has upgraded a bit since then. I waivered between 3 and 4 stars for here.  

We arrived at 8:30 on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. Definitely agree that it can get a bit loud in here and we noticed that when we came in.

The overall look of the place is sort of chain-restauranty. They did some work to make it have a middle eastern feel, but it is fairly generic I think. They have a lot of tables squished in, along with the bar. We were seated to the side of the door next to the bar, so we had a bit of a wall blocking us from the noise and no one as close as the rest of the restaurant seating was.

Our waitress Natasha was super friendly and jovial. I think she had many tables scattered around, so even though she wanted to check in, it would take her awhile to come back. She verbally noticed when bringing the pita and za'atar that I was ready for a refill, but didn't make it back for over 5 minutes. While waiting for a box, or the check, it was just a little longer than you would expect, especially since it cleared out as we were eating.

We both went with the iced teas. Pomegranate for mom and Black for me. They were super flavorful and tasty and we both had about 3 glasses. For dinner, I went with the Shish Tawook and mom the Mujadara. It looks like the menu stays the same through the day, but they offer a large or small option. We both went with the small plate (around $10-12 for most items), and it was more than enough for dinner.  Loved the hot, fresh pita with za'atar/oil dipping sauce.

My plate came with about 6-7 smaller chunks of of chicken from a skewer for the Shish Tawook. I was honestly expecting a little bit more meat, but what I had was moist and flavorful. The garlic sauce that accompanied it was sooo garlicy and delicious, but would take out a few vampires, so just be aware. The grilled veggies were mainly made up of 4 large sections of cauliflower which I don't like (mom got them), a little squash/zucchini and onion. The rice was tasty and a majority of the plate. It filled me up. Just a little pricey for one small skewer to me.

Mom's really liked her Mujardara. She was pleased with the amount of lentils as she was concerned it would be too rice-heavy. It was a very large amount and she was able to take half of it home. The salata on top was not extensive, but it gave it some color. 

Overall, we liked the experience. I think we lucked out getting the table behind the bar area with how raucous the rest of the restaurant seemed. I think it may have lost a star otherwise. Service was friendly, yet a little delayed. Prices decent, but when rice takes up a lot of the plate/meal, it isn't the greatest value with minimal meat.

For lunch you will struggle between the rolls (Falafel & Lamb rolls kick major butt) which come with delicious spicy fries (no ketchup required - dieters may elect the healthy cous cous) and the Salads.

Unfortunately, we came when everyone else wanted some happy hour drinks at Paladar and we were absolutely famished. We stumbled (our bodies were shutting down at this point--we needed food!!) down to Taza and debated going in since we were in such a Latin mood, but noticed the $4 martini sign and decided to give it a shot. 

We ended up incredibly thankful that Taza advertised their Thursday special so well! What a crowded blessing in disguise our original plan became!

Unfortunately, we got seated at the quiet, hidden date table and felt like they were trying to hide us from the other guests--were we that sad and hungry looking?! We ended up moving a table closer to the dining area and bar to feel more like part of the group. 

Our waiter, Tom (I think) was perfect! He explained the martinis to us and made sure we knew what the best-sellers were so we could make some educated decisions. I went with the Taza-tini and Shayna had the Mango-tini. Both were good, but mango won when we ordered our second round. The pita you get to start your meal is fabulous. Warm, fluffy and SO good. The dipping oil was good, too, though we didn't know what it was...I still enjoyed it!

We shared the Lebanese Jibneh (cheese!!!) and it was probably the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. The pomegranate sauce was so good that I regretted letting Tom (seriously, I'm so sorry if that wasn't his name) take the plate; I wanted to soak the rest of it up with some bread. For an entree, we shared the Shawarma Fatteh. The shawarma was some of the best meat I've ever had--it melted in your mouth and was seasoned perfectly. 

We also got to hear and sit right next to the live music! So fun! And the decor was very pretty and didn't strike me as gaudy or tacky, though I really generally don't like the garden dining seating. 

The only complaint I have is that the entree was incredibly heavy. It was overloaded with chickpeas and pita chips and not as much meat, so we ended up super full and starchy, though that was an improvement upon our state when we arrived.

The bread is better here.  It's not pita bread, don't let them fool you, but it was soft and warm and delicious.  Unfortunately I filled up on it waiting for our food.  And since we only ordered mezza items, that's a bit disconcerting.  The service could have been better.  The oil spice mix with the bread was flavorless.  Maybe they read these reviews and cut out salt entirely (which was oddly not provided on the table, I noticed).  A surprise favorite of mine were the sausages in a cherry sauce.  I don't remember what they were called.  Spinach pies also quite good.  Kibbee and grape leaves were a bit mushy, a problem I've also found at Aladdin's.  If they fixed that, I think the flavors are pretty spot on.

All in all, I'll skip Taza for Aladdin's.

Over the years I've come to realize that I've transitioned into seeking value (as well as many other things) in my dining experiences. 

That's where I struggle with Taza...

I love Aladdin's. I really like Taza--I don't like the price difference. And honestly, besides a few upgrades I didn't really notice a difference. There are so many options to eat healthy on both menus, which I really appreciate. And everything I've tried is very tasty--so that's why Taza still gets 4 stars. Furthermore, the service both my mother and I received on our last visit was 5-star, for sure. 

But Aladdin's is really just as good. And that price difference just bothers me to no end. I guess you're paying more for the location??

I will say their mango iced tea is awesome. So is their Lebanese Salata, which I usually add grilled chicken to. Their chicken is always perfectly seasoned and cooked."},{"source": "T7weU8D-PrX8tGrAFJOSxw", "target": "Nwc26t96TlTijEK2RZd-ew", "type": "red", "rv": "You call this Lebanese? 

Now I may be picky when it comes to falafel. It is a favorite of mine but this place had more problems than just overcooked falafel. 

We were sat at a table where you could see the oven and the pita. Well I found the gas open air oven laughable and the pita. . .way too leavened. After we had ordered the waitress brought some of the not so great pita and this oil spice mix. The oil spice mix was WAY TOO SALTY. 

Our food did come fast which was a pleasant surprise. Though the food was disappointing. My falafel was so over cooked. The exterior was nearly black while the middle was like paste. eww. The 2 dressings that came with the salad were nothing special. The tahini was exactly what you get at Aladins, and the lemon dressing just tasted like lemon infused olive oil. . .only more greasy. I don't know what my date had nor could I care much less after watching him check out every girl that walked by.  But I will say this french fries under no circumstance are Lebanese.
After the horrid date I had had I was more horrified with the wait to get the check. OVER 20 MINUTES!! way too long for it being nearly empty.

Part of the Cleveland-based Aladdin's restaurant chain (which has locations in Chicago, Charlotte, Raleigh, Toledo, Detroit, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Arlington and San Antonio!), Taza is known for its wide variety of traditional mezza (Lebanese for 'tapas,' or appetizers). Taza has been referred to as an upscale Aladdin's. This place is such a staple in my food-life and I am so excited to finally share it with all of you!

Much like Aladdin's (which is also amazing, you should go if there is a location near you!), options are all meant to be shared family-style (include hummus, stuffed grape leaves, pickled turnips, olives and cucumber, and cinnamon-scented sausages). Every meal also begins with (my favorite part!) fresh pita bread, prepared in Taza's beehive oven and served with olives, yogurt and olive oil. I love this bread so much that I normally plan my meal around it! I like enjoying at least 2 pieces, so I normally just order soup so that I don't have to get carried out of the restaurant with a crane. The soup is delicious though, so it's really the best of both worlds! I've had many things of the menu, including fresh, flavorful salads, sandwiches and kebabs. While they are all excellent, nothing tops the doughiness of the pita for me, so I stick to my bread and soup. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The restaurant owner knows me, the Mister and my family by name -- we come here THAT often. I'd say we go to this restaurant at least 3 times a month.

Taza is a smaller restaurant and has an intimate feel to it. I probably didn't capture it well in the photos, but the lighting is remarkable and very romantic.

All of the action can be observed in the restaurant's open kitchen, which sits behind a glass partition. 

TAZA also carries gourmet teas. My favorite flavor (pineapple green tea)  is so refreshing and I cannot find it ANYWHERE else. I look forward to savoring a cup every time I go to TAZA.

As I mentioned before, 9/10 times I order the Chicken Nine Vegetable Soup. It is homemade and includes all the fresh, seasonal veggies TAZA has that week.

But I'll be honest, my favorite part of the meal is the BREAD. These pillowy clouds of heaven are accompanied by a mouth-watering seasame oil dipping sauce, which I could easily guzzle down by the bottle - so delicious ;)

The staff and owners of TAZA are also fabulous and once you go here a few times, they'll remember you by name, too and greet you with a smile (or sometimes a hug!). Hands down, one of my favorite restaurants."},{"source": "T7weU8D-PrX8tGrAFJOSxw", "target": "RKfjyoEeoOeylWkjGU0scw", "type": "red", "rv": "Much like Aladdin's the food here is good.

The appetizer sampler is great. You get some baba, some hummos, some falafel, pita and i think i am forgetting something, Maybe dawali? Anyway it was all very fresh and delicious. It is an upgraded Aladdin's, and there is always one of the family there working the crowd, saying hello. I particularly like supporting a local cleveland family place that has been around forever!

I have been here several times for lunch with coworkers and without fail we have always had good food, and a good experience.   

I am vegetarian so this restaurant is great because they have many options available, but to be honest, I stick with the Rolled Falafel, because it is just that good.   I have had the regular Rolled Falafel and the Hummus Rolled Falafel (which is Vegan BTW).   They are both just killer, but I prefer the regular over the hummus variation if I had to pick one (which is almost like saying which kid do you like better LOL).

NOTE: The French fries are friggen delish - they have some kind of middle eastern seasoning on them (which is salty so if that ain't your thing be advised) and I recommend them with the rolled falafel.

SECOND NOTE: The bread they give you which is pita and almost like a Roti with flavored oil is also killer so ask for it if they don't give it to you for some reason.   They have always brought it out - even at lunch time and it is nice and hot.

The restaurant is in the insanely crazy, with not enough parking - Eton Center, over off of Chagrin Blvd (which in itself is a zoo) so be prepared for traffic and to have to hunt for a parking space depending on when you go.   The restaurant is clean and the service has always been very good.   I never had to ask for a refill of my water - the server just swung by on a regular basis and topped it off.

I came here for dinner with some of my coworkers and all in all, i like it. Here's a quick (not so quick) summary.

Atmosphere (3): It's a nice classy sit down dinner. But the echoes in the room just isn't very good. We had a table of 6 and I had a hard time hearing across the table because it was just...very loud in the restaurant.

Food (3.5): It was good & average. I have yet to find a Mediterranean place in Cleveland that beats Aladdin Eatery (quality, quantity, and price combined). The food at Taza was good if it was about $5 cheaper. Here's how I came to a food rating of 3.5:

1. Side bread + Hummus (3.5) -- nicely made bread, nicely made hummus. It's delicious but so are all the other Mediterranean places I've been. Although, i loved the sesame seed sauce that came with the bread!

2. French Fries Appetizer (4.5) -- yum! It was perfectly fried with just a touch of seasoning on it. And how come I never knew how good fries + hummus was??

3. Hummos Chicken Entree (3) -- Very good portion, but the chicken wasn't very tender & it lacked flavor. I've had chicken at other Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland where the chicken meat was full of flavor and extremely tender and that's how I like my meat. But at Taza, it was just okay.

Price (3.5) -- pricey, but it is in Eaton Square so you've got to give it a slack.

Service (4) -- good. The waitress was attentive and made sure we were always satisfied with our meal, checking on us from time to time.

On a side note, one of my coworker ordered the Hummos Shwarma and I was drooling watching him eat it. Next time I come back, I think that's what I'm going to order.

Bland as could be. I ate only a few bites to sustain my hunger. The server had initially brought us hot pitas we were supposed to dip into a blend of oils and herbs while we waited for our food to arrive, but she never came round to give us the dip. And when our food arrived I asked if I could have some fresh pitas for my hummus and she pointed to the ones that had gotten cold as we had not had anything to eat them with and gave a great attitude about bringing more. My husband had ordered fries and she never brought the ketchup. So they also got cold while he waited. Eventually a busser came by, sweeping the floor and we got him to bring us some ketchup and pitas. Then we sat for an eternity waiting to ask for our check and some boxes. No opportunity for drink refills during our lunch. Eager to get out of there, I went to the restroom and came back and we decided to give it six more minutes.

The food was just ok. We started out with one of the appetizer samplers (with meat) and it was awesome. We also got a side of falafel that was somewhat dry. If we had just stuck with the appetizer plate that would have been enough because there is a ton of food on that plate. For my entree I got the mixed grill and OMG that rice. The rice comes with cinnamon which seems like an odd choice at first but is so delicious. The grilled vegetables were also pretty great. The meat however, was not. My chicken was undercooked...which if that's ever happened to you, you know how gross it is. The lamb was just ok, a little on the dry side, and the kafta was decent as well.

It comes with a variety of vegetarian and meat items to share. Everything tasted fresh and burst with flavor. I usually don't like the combination of pickled turnips, cucumbers and tomatoes, but I actually quite enjoyed this!

I ordered the beef kafta rolled pita for myself, which comes with fries. Again, also delicious. It has a garlic sauce already in there, and unlike most places that drench the sauce to cover up the taste of everything else, this one was perfectly done. Sure, a little bit dripped onto my plate, but that meant I got to dip the fries in it. Yum! The fries also come with some toasted sesame seeds on top.

One of the best things about this place is the bread. It's fresh pita bread, and ask for refills! It was hot, steamy and delicious. They bring you two kinds, one is in the triangle shape, and the other looks like a puffed up saucer. The latter is amazing and super fun to eat!

  The pancakes and crepes are delicious,  the omelettes are light and fluffy,  and the gluten free pancakes are exceptional.  But the best part of the meal is by far the BACON!!! Unlike any other that we've tasted,  it's crispy and thick cut,  and completely head and  shoulders above any other's. My mouth is watering at the thought of it! 
   We also enjoy the warmth of this family owned restaurant;  the owners are always present making customers feel at  home and making sure that the restaurant is clean and comfortable for their diners.

Delicious pancakes and plenty of options in the lineup. I had some with pecans and something else. Just super, folks. Super stuff. 

The corned beef hash was a solid B. I've had better and much worse. 

I'll go back here for the bacon."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "ckaUh0DY4wJNSy0EMj2Krw", "type": "red", "rv": "This is an excellent place!  Were traveling and made a plan to only eat at places that are original to us, and not eat at them more than once while on the road.  But we have to admit, this was the only place we broke our own rule with and ate here twice!

I tried the crepes and chocolate chip pancakes (on separate visits).  The portions on both were HUGE, so I would recommend getting 2 single crepes and a side of pancakes if your not starving enough to handle a huge portion.  

He had the coconut pancakes and swore by the orange jelly (I think it was a jelly) that came with it...and the bacon was amazing (I stole a piece from his plate each visit).  

The only think that was confusing was when were there on the weekend we had the check paid at the table, however when we were there on a Monday (in a rush no less) we didn't know to pay at the register...we tried a few times to flag someone down until we found out.  If this is a weekday rule, it may be helpful to let people know. This by no means is a weighing negative, just a suggestion."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "CLbpPUqP6XpeAfoqScGaJQ", "type": "blue", "rv": "Popular breakfast/brunch spot in the area, and being unimpressed by the nearby Bob Evans and intrigued by the somewhat unique menu, I decided to give this place a shot. There was a 20-25 minute wait on Saturday at 11 AM, which is to be expected. Atmosphere and decor is what you'd expect. Typical hustle and bustle of a busy brunch spot. One thing I thought I was kind of cool was that they had art on display along the walls from local artists that you could purchase if you were so inclined. Service was great. Attentive and very friendly. 

Onto the food though, I ordered *deep breath*:

- Biscuits and gravy - Delicious. Gravy was good with huge chunks of breakfast sausage. The two biscuits were nice and buttery but not as flaky and puffy as I had hoped and just a little bit dry.  My favorite dish out of what I ordered.
- Seafood omelette - This was HUGE. I would guess their omelettes are at least 5 eggs. Inside was crabmeat and shrimp, outside was hollandaise sauce and few leaves of spinach. I could have (and have) made this omelette myself. The sauce was good, and there wasn't enough spinach. Disappointed overall.
- Banana pancakes - Thin and dry, with an almost overpowering banana extract flavor. Very disappointed.
- Dutch Baby - This is what I came here for. They give you a side of lemons, powdered sugar, and whipped butter. USE THE LEMONS. At first I tried a piece without the sides, and it really didn't taste like much of anything. I was expecting crepe/elephant ear, but all I got back was a very mild flavor with a squishy soggy french toast like consistency. I squeezed the lemons and lots of powdered sugar, then it started to taste good. Still not enough to warrant the hype IMO. I had to drizzle syrup over it to really enjoy it.

Yes this was all mine. $30 for breakfast. I finished everything except 3 of the 4 banana pancakes. Yes, I'm a pig. Our server commended me and even let the manager know. Friendly staff.

What others in my party ordered:
- Corned Beeef Hash omelette - HUGE. Not enough corned beef, and potato chunks were too big. I could have (and have) made this better at home.
- Pecan pancakes - Decent, nothing special. Not really pecan infused. Just pancakes with pecans.

Miscellaneous... their orange juice was fresh squeezed and definitely tasted like it. Very good.

I would go back again to try a few other things on the menu, but I doubt I'll be a regular patron.  First Watch is much closer to me and tastes better."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "dX5eNdD_qrkcwVnud3Ykog", "type": "red", "rv": "I stopped in with my husband with on a Sunday around 2 pm for a very late breakfast. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and the server immediately took out drink orders. 

This was my first time at this location but I ordered my usual, the strawberry waffle. The husband ordered the pecan waffle, farm-style sausage, home fries and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was quite cool because of the whipped cream so keep that in mind. Our server quickly replaced it sans whip and he said it was pretty tasty. Free refills on hot chocolate, BTW. 

The food was out in less than 10 minutes - everything was great and on par with other locations."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "fs-UAg5vsoUYtCX_US7qGw", "type": "red", "rv": "We love coming here for breakfast!  We have pretty much always stuck to pancakes, so I do not have the most broad prospective.  We have had blueberry, pumpkin, chocolate chip, and chocolate & peanut butter chip and have never been disappointed.  I tend to lean towards getting the 1/2 portion because of how large the portions are.  They do not take reservations or call ahead seating.  So, be prepared to wait.  They are normally very accurate with their wait times.  Also, they will not seat you unless your party is all there (which I am a fan of because it really does keep everything moving.)  Once you are seated, we have never had an issue with service.  Service has always been efficient and prompt.  The coffee is delicious and I would highly recommend it.  We normally get a side of bacon, and yes it is on the pricy side for bacon, but it is not bulk packaged bacon either and, in our opinion, worth the few extra dollars.  You pay at the counter and the girls there have always been very courteous."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "gzE5dfmxNYj5y0fIJBVblQ", "type": "red", "rv": "We weren't the last customers of the day and they already ran out of bananas and bacon? We got half a banana order and no bacon :-( 
On the plus side, the whipped cream for the banana was sweet and light.  Yummy.

Wifey ordered the dutch baby, which came out 15 minutes sooner than the rest of our food. I'm not sure if that is customary, but usually all our entrees are brought out to everyone at the same time. She didn't care much that her pancake had burned sides and a butter pool, but it tasted pretty good to me. 

My brother's cheesy omelet was definitely a wonderment of constipation. He stopped eating his pancakes because he found a curly hair in the stack. I'm not sure, but my sister said that her turkey sausages tasted like beef. Nephew was supposed to have a scrambled egg with his waffle, but sadly, it never arrived. 

My eggs were prepared properly as were the sausage links and potatoes, but I was a bit disappointed that the potatoes were soggy and bland, as if they were prepared hours ago or came from the frozen food section. I just prefer crispier taters with some seasoning. I want flava - it's a restaurant, not a retirement home. 

Drinks were refilled at a good pace and I think that our server did the very best she could despite the circumstances. She did explain our situation to the manager (without any prompting from us), who came by the table to adjust the bill and apologize for the inconveniences. 

The cashier/hostess area was vacant for about five minutes while a line formed behind me before the store manager walked over to ring up my bill.

I couldn't help but smile while leaving because the waitress seemed happy about the tip I left on her table.  I believe in maintaining good karma from the foodie gods."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "gZrGXlYS77D5_6Tn4eE22A", "type": "red", "rv": "What was ordered:
Breakfast for two

Ham and cheese omelet - This was an enormous omelet. Meh the omelet itself was okay. Luke warm ham chunks and a mound of cheddar cheese plopped on top - next time I'll order something else.  I'd give it 2.5 stars for taste and 1 for presentation. 

Huevos Rancheros - In the bite that I had, I thought the green chili was surprisingly tasty and the eggs were cooked to order.  

As for the side of pancakes, they were average.  I expected a little more from a self titled pancake house.  The pancakes were a little too firm and lacking some fluff.  Maybe a large stack would have been fluffier?

Total was about $28 including tax and tip.
_____________

The service was okay and for a Sunday morning and the wait was reasonable.  (I think about 10 minutes for a table of 2).   One thing that bothers me about this place is that a cup of coffee is $2.09.  $2 is steep and then they charge the extra 9 cents to be extra greedy!  Sure sure, I sound like a miser writing this, but come on Pancake House!!!  It's criminal to be charging this much for a cup of of coffee to go with breakfast.   

To sum it up, for your average $10-12 enormous breakfast + $2.09 cup of coffee, The Original Pancake House is an okay/overpriced option.  Don't go in with high expectations.  I consider it one step above IHOP.  2.5 stars overall, but I'll round up to 3."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "H4W1CyyrU3Ru3rcSMkCG7g", "type": "red", "rv": "This place has simply amazing pancakes. On weekends there is often an hour's wait, but trust me, it's worth it. Although these pancakes are not cheap if you are looking for an upscale breakfast spot this may be just right.

Flavors range from traditional berry to bananas foster pancakes, toasted coconut, potato pancakes, sourdough, pineapple, swedish pancakes and more. They even have specialty pancakes, like the dutch baby that is oven baked and served with lemon and whipped butter, and an oven baked apple pancake that is fit for dessert.

I can't remember the last time I went anywhere else for breakfast and took home leftovers but here I always leave stuffed. The long wait on weekends (I'm told there is no wait during the week but I can never make it then because they have limited hours). It pays to be hungry. Once you get a table, the servers are friendly, fast and keep the coffee refills coming. There is also a large selection of breakfast meats, crepes and omelettes. 

One warning, don't leave and go across to the B&N if you are waiting, if you don't hear them call your name you will lose your place in line. 

Located in a little strip mall across from Eton place, it doesn't look like anything special and you could drive by a dozen times without stopping.

I've been coming here with my mom since I was a little kid! 

OPH is my absolute favorite breakfast/ brunch restaurant, and it's clearly a beloved gem to Woodmere because it's always poppin' when I come, and there's usually a wait. But I don't even care, because the food will blow your mind, and leave you in warm carb coma oblivion. 

Here's a tip: get a side of bacon. Who cares about your arteries and cholesterol. Your taste buds and stomach will thank you. It's super thick cut, smokey, and it'll give your taste buds the tango of a life time. 

Corn beef hash is always bomb! The potatoes are super delicious.

What's not to love?

The food is generally good for brunch. I like the omelets, which are rolled, meaning their cooked in a skillet and finished off in the oven. They're generously portioned and can easily be shared. Their omelet options are pretty standard  (e.g. ham & cheese, western, veggie). For an up-charge of  $1.39, they can also be made with egg whites.

Their breakfast meats are pretty good, but pricey. Their Daily's Bacon is pretty nice--thick cut, slightly chewy, slightly crispy, salty enough--but is over $5 for four strips. The other meats are right under $5. Their healthier meat option is turkey sausage, which is not good.

Their pancakes are obviously their stars. With many, many options to choose from, your bound to find something for you. I like their 49er and Dutch Baby.  I will say, though, their pancake batter (from which most of their pancakes are made) is pretty basic. There's nothing that makes it distinctive, like Meyer lemon juice or even more buttermilk. It's good pancake, but I'm left yearning for more.

The staff is generally friendly and checks in on you.  However, on the weekends, you can expect to call your server once or twice because of how busy it is. Also, the wait can be lengthy on the weekends. From 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., expect 30-45 minutes for a party of 2-4.

If you're looking for a good brunch place that's reasonably priced, come here. They've got something for everyone and it's and old standby. However, Cleveland is full of great brunch places, so I strongly encourage you to venture out because you find anything on the OPH menu elsewhere that's tastier and/ or reimagined."},{"source": "W3PgeyVrAjgK0X6ZLX-hfg", "target": "oKesRsDlwjm5q06Kqterqg", "type": "red", "rv": "Always good breakfest food here......never disappointed.

 Thankfully I don't live closer, or I would eat here for breakfast all the time and gain 50 lbs. The Pancakes are pretty good, not gonna lie. But the omelets are also amazing, not to mention huge!

I was surprised when I heard about this place. People were raving to me- original pancake house is awesome! So off I went on my birthday with my parents....the moment I woke up.

It looked so unfamiliar to me...until I walked in and looked at the menu. Wait a second, I told my parents, I've had that dutch apple baby before!!! They just looked at me with a look that said- yes, Rachael, you probably have.

A few years ago, a few friends and I made a road trip to Chicago...and happened to stop by this amazing breakfast place in the Chicago suburbs. I asked- and yep, this place is indeed a chain! I ordered my long lost missed dutch apple pancake right away. My parents got something else. I don't remember- I was too overly happy that I got to eat that big bad pancake.

Imagine an egg tart.... in gigantic form with apples. That's pretty much it. I messed up ordering, (I think I said dutch and not dutch apple?) so it came out wrong..and the waitress wasn't too happy with me wanting my dutch apple. She was actually pretty rude about it....but whatevers... I really wanted it. It wasn't the same as I remember tho- when I had it before, it was crunchy on top...this was more of a soggy apple mess..but still, it was GOOD.

Original Pancake House.  A sure thing.  Hate the setting, Mid-west Strip Mall Contemporary.  Hate the section of Chagrin Boulevard, where it transitions from two lanes, to one lane turn only, to no lanes that ever move because Eton shoppers are texting their Whole Foods organic mung bean recipes while driving.

The omelets are excellent too, but I wish they came with hash browns instead of 3 pancakes.  A side dish is wholly unnecessary when you've got a 6-egg omelet to deal with -- can we say heart attack on a plate? - but for the sake of variety I do like a little something on the side, and hash browns seem like a much better pairing than pancakes.

I now know that this place is no less a chain than eat'n park and frankly, wish I would have listened to my father (a recurring theme throughout life eh?)

I walked in, they had two hostesses on duty, it appeared as they had one busser and a handful of servers.  We sat after wandering their entrance area not seeing anyone, encountering the hostess on our way to a table, she seated us and provided menus.  My dad and I just wanted a good omelette.  Our server was nice, and enjoyed pouring our coffee from varying heights above the cup, and god bless her not a drop splashed onto my white shirt.  The coffee wasn't nearly as respectable as their fair trade organic whatever seal of green approval stuff made me think.  I ordered a mexican omelette and added sausage (they didn't have chorizo :-( not cool), my father had the same, less the meat.  It comes with three pancakes, no browns (yeah, no potatoes and it still cost $9!)  Long story short, it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food, when we did, we saw these three inch high round monstrosities of egg and filling and cheese.  I didn't know where to start!  I ate my pancakes.  They were delicious.  It was obvious to me that the cooks they had had no business cooking breakfasts.  The omelettes aren't folded, and had obviously stuck to the pan as they were a crumbly, mangled mess of overcooked eggs and filling.  They weren't bad tasting, but texture has a lot to do with a great omelette, and this place seemed to forget to read that chapter.

I finished my water and gave up on trying to drink the coffee, my father had emptied both of his beverages having only had a few bites of our meal.  A tall man (who I suspect was the manager) stopped by and said Enjoy guys, everything looks good!  I chuckled in disbelief and sorrow as it obviously didn't look good, and the manager never really asked us what we thought, that's just a little bit of BS.  Anyway, our drinks needed filled when he stopped by, and obviously he didn't even know what to look for at a table when checking on them, as he should have had that server out within seconds with refills, instead we had our breakfast lube-free only getting refills once we were finished.

I had coffee and eggs Benedict (which was served with three piping hot pancakes, to my surprise) and my friend had hot orange tea and a bacon waffle.
The eggs Benedict was made as it usually is, but with very, very thick slices of grilled ham, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  It was wonderful and pleasantly not greasy or super heavy.  The ham was not super salty, the eggs were perfect and the sauce was not oily/greasy.  I gave half of the order, which was served with home-fries and pancakes, to my friend, who was eyeing it!  
Since I didn't want to eat all of it myself, I shared.  Her waffle was crisp on the outside, evenly cooked, and fluffy on the inside with crisp bacon throughout. The bacon waffle was served with syrup and butter.  The three pancakes that accompanied my dish were hot (nothing sits under a heat lamp, here) and didn't need any toppings...they were good.  Flavorful, not sweet, not dry, not bland.  They were a very happy medium.  I topped them with a bit of syrup, and as good as they were, I could only eat a couple of bites as I simply had too much food, even after sharing.

Up to date I have always excepted that the delicious offerings here seem to come with a side of sub-par service. Today was truly rough though, and for that a less-than-stellar review shall finally be written.  

Our waitress, although nice and knowledgeable really struggled with getting our table of four''s needs met... and we were not asking for a ton!  We all went without refills several times, the food came out in the most random sequence imaginable, and most of the items were in some way or another jacked-up versions of what we had actually ordered.  Don't get me wrong, I still ate the accouterments that were delivered after my entree had been finished, but with every bite I choked back a hint of dismay. 

In the waitress' defense, she did drop a small discount on to our bill without us verbally saying a word, but still the service challenges outweighed the gesture. However, I would much rather pay full price and write a glowing five-star review after a well executed dining experience, but the truths need to be told, and I have the free time to write them.

On the plus side, the food, although not really what we had ordered was edible and in a few cases, pretty good. Check the place out for yourself, but perhaps order off the menu WITHOUT ANY substitutes and try to keep your group down to a casual two.

The Spicy Shrimp is delicate, just tell them you don't need the potatoe chips sopping up your juices.

I will not be back and I know a lot of other people in our party felt the same way.  There was nothing about our party that was good. The server, Mark, I believe was actually very nice and funny. Other than that --- they only wanted to give us half the room, the food was terrible. 

We started with cold appetizers: Shrimp, Some lox/cream cheese concoction, spinach and artichoke dip, a cheese plate (if you can call it that). This is where the problem began, the shrimp was not de-veined, we had to send it back after people had already been eating it. The dip was watery, the cheese plate was literally what looked like store bought cheese pieces on a tacky silver platter. There was zero substance. 

The hot appetizers were out before the guests arrived - my boss sent them back and requested they come out later once more guests arrive (From my own restaurant experience this is generally discussed when the party is booked, I don't know where lay the miscommunication). Anyway, the food was taken back and then brought back out later. Due to quality of the served food, I hope it was sitting under heat lamps for that hour and a half. I would have been embarrassed to put out that product. We had: pizza, brie balls, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, chicken kabobs, there may have been one or two more. The brie balls were basically just breading, the prosciutto was sooo overcooked and tough it was hard to eat, the chicken was BEYOND dry. They were all served warm but were basically room temperature. We were all starving so we ate them but had anyone been there to dine and been served that food it would have been sent back immediately. 

On top of that: there was no bartender in the room so all of wine for the party was siting on a table in the corner. It was 100% self serve. The food display was also abysmal -- to the point where someone came in half way through the party to make it look somewhat presentable.

The bread that comes with dinner was warm and toasty. The garlic and sun dried tomato spread was superb, dahhling.

The salads- My rents got a wedge and split it. Good size. I had one myself.  It came with blue cheese,and blue cheese dressing.  The server even offered to bring us some bacon!  Of course I took the bacon!  This was a standard wedge salad. Everything was very fresh.

First, cost is not everything, as we are not cheap and are always willing to pay more for special dinners out, but it's worth mentioning right off the bat: this place is expensive. Like, REALLY expensive for what it is (a chain restaurant).

The Fleming's salad I ordered was akin to salads I've gotten out of the grab and go section from Sheetz - instead of crisp greens, it was all huge chunks of the white stems of the lettuce and a lot of it was browning and bitter. 

The small medium rare steaks we ordered were overcooked (his was well done) or barely cooked (mine was blue). Our waiter was nowhere to be found and we decided to not wait for him to come around to send them back. 

The service was...not great. I'm just going to go ahead and stop reporting this dumb list of grievances because I really am not a hater. I'll just say the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way because it was too expensive a meal to be as shitty as it was.

They have really good food for being part of a chain and the interior is nicely done.  They went through a rough patch for a while when managers were flying out the door faster than their filet mignon, but it seems as though they have it ironed out now.

One of the draws to this place is the bartender Anthony.  He's a little rough around the edges, but knows his wines and remembers everything about people.  When my wife was pregnant, we didn't stop in for almost 10 months and when we did, he shook our hands and asked about our favorite glasses of wine which he remembered.  Not bad for a chain.

The lamb here is probably the best in the area.  Top quality and cooked to perfection every time.  Any steak that you choose is better than you would get a Red's and less expensive.  The fish is good too, but I haven't sampled too much of it.  I'll go to a fish restaurant if I want fish.  I go to a steak restaurant to order red meat or pork.

The gratin potatoes here are not as good as at Hyde Park, but the sautéed spinach is outta control.  The asparagus is great as are most of the salads, but it is really the proteins which stand out as the stars on the menu.

The service is great in the bar area, but I would give it a 50/50 shot in the main dining room.  There's one Russian waiter who is just the pits.  He screws up everything.  Flemings has probably given out more free desserts due to his mistakes than all the other waiters combined.    A free dessert, by the way, doesn't make up for screwing up the dining experience.

One last reason to come here is that you can try almost 100 bottles by the glass.  They are not cheap, but it is nice to try wines from different areas of the world without having to throw down on an entire bottle.  Just make sure that your wine is fresh- ask them, they will tell you if it is or not.

Heard the place was decent from another friend, so we decided to give it a try. Inside the restaurant has a decent classy feel, and since it was a weekday, not too many people showed up. 

To start off the night, we got appetizers and a flight of red wine (3 smaller portions). I enjoyed the flight of red wine because it gave me the option to try different wines. The waiter was also very helpful when I needed help to select my wines. Unfortunately, I don't remember the appetizer we got, but I have to say a lot of appetizers looked pretty good on their menu.

As for main course, these are definitely one of the pricier steaks I've seen. However, the quality of the steak was definitely up to par. For both my boyfriend and I, we got Bone in Ribeye and Fillet Mignon. Although I've had ribeye steak before, but this one definitely made a lasting impression on me. The portion was ginormous and the meat was definitely fatty. If you enjoy some fatty meat once in a while, this is the place to give it a try. I also tried the fillet mignon, which was very tender and delicious as well. I am very glad that the Fleming's was generous with their serving sizes, unlike some other upscale restaurants where a 30-40 dollar steak is the size of a baby's fist.

For dessert, we got the chocolate lava cake. And since it took them a while to make, we had to order it 20 minutes before we finished our main course. But oh man, this was worth the wait! The fresh and hot lava cake was just delicious. If nothing else, I'd totally go back to this place just for their lava cake next time.

To let you know, I do not favor pretentious or trendy restaurants - I do favor good to great service, well-prepared food, and a clean/comfortable atmosphere.  I don't think that is asking too much...in other words, I don't think that I am a high maintenance customer.

This was our first visit to Fleming's at the Eton Collection, dinner at 5pm on a Saturday night, before heading downtown for an event.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The dining room was about 1/4 full, but it filled up to near capacity by the time we left at 6:15pm.

Sean was our waiter, and was great -  he was very attentive and aware.  The general vibe was good, all different age groups.  I saw one child, probably about 9 years old, but in general I wouldn't say this is a restaurant for kids.  Most people were dressed up, but neat casual is ok.

We each had the petite filet mignon and shared a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  Sean told us that the sides are big enough for two people, and he was right - although in my own house I could have EASILY eaten all the garlic mashed potatoes myself!

The filet was very good, but when they tell you that the plates are HOT, believe it...my partner accidentally touched it a couple of minutes after being served, and it was an ouch moment.

Also - the bread was great (a detail that always makes me happy), partner really liked his french onion soup.  After reading other Yelp reviews we ordered the chocolate lava cake, which was verrrrrrry good...they serve it with a very good vanilla nice cream and with pistachios.

All in all, a very positive visit.  I don't eat a lot of steak, but the next time I am at Eton I may return and have a sandwich at the bar."},{"source": "wHG_iKBpUfizBFIGqoaUnQ", "target": "YZ-o5tw5r2IXbiVQQaVmhQ", "type": "blue", "rv": "The food is always WONDERFUL!

Thankfully we showed up for happy hour with a snacky appetite and thirsty palates.  

Happy hour here (even on a Saturday) had deals on wine, select apps, and burgers.  We decide to go with the wine specials and order off the happy hour menu since we were not planning on getting a $40 steak dinner plus sides.  We will save that for another day, maybe a date night.  We just wanted to blow through the $50 gift card as fast as we could.  

The bartender started us off with homemade potato chips, lightly salted, to get our thirst going.  Perfect munchies while we browsed the menu.  After a bowl of chips and 2 glasses of wine, a booth opened up in the bar area so we decided to plop a squat and order something a little more substantial.  For starters we went with the calamari and beef carpaccio.  Both were delicious and would order again in an instant.   It was enough for both to share.  Even though its happy hour, the special apps are full size.  For dinner the wife went with lamb and I ordered the French Onion soup - probably the best FOS I've had in a long time.  I can't say that it's authentic using onions only, no beef stock, but between the flavor of the soup and the cheese factor, oochie mama, daddy wants some more.  The chops were hit and miss.  Two were over cooked but the flavor was spot on.  

Each thing we ordered are described below.

TENDERLOIN CARPACCIO*
caper creole mustard sauce and red onion

SWEET CHILE CALAMARI
lightly breaded and tossed with sweet chile sauce

FRENCH ONION SOUP
baked with gruyere and parmesan cheeses

NEW ZEALAND PETITE LAMB CHOPS*
pistachio-mint pesto, F17 sauce, polenta fries

I would definitely hit Flemings for happy hour again, especially knowing they run it on Saturday.  However, I think everyone has caught on since it was packed when we arrived and packed when we left.  If you want to do a little research, check out their website.  Flemings lists the items on their 5 for $6 menu but I believe the items are rotated in and out.  Another hint, take the free valet, parking can be a bitch.  Lastly, if your cheap or just like to save some cash, you can get $100 in gift cards from Costco for $80.

Every dish starting with appetizers to entree to dessert are true celebrations of the taste. Paladar definitely has a weak spot for plantains - fries thin cut as chips for dipping in guacamole, to caramelized accompaniment with entree to sweet fried with dessert. 

Their currently special appetizer - Prosciutto  wrapped beef skewers with spicy peanut sauce leave you craving more almost wishing it could be made into an entree. The meat is tender and burst with jerk flavor that's just right. 

Their 3 different flavored Civiche (Shrimp, Tuna, or Salmon) are sweet & tangy explosion of diced fish, Plantains, Pickled Red Onions, Basil & Pineapple, & citrus flavor that is a flavor explosion in with every bite.

Even a simple sounding entree like 'SLOW SMOKED CHICKEN' keeps you wanting more even if you feel stuffed.  This particular dish is tender shredded slow cooked chicken tossed in a Guajillo Marinade atop Columbian Arepas and Sweet Plantains finished with our Spicy Aji Pepper Sauce. This is a genius amalgamation of Caribbean flavors

The 'Rum bar' part of the name of Paladar truly holds up given the extensive light & dark rum.  My most favorite is their 'Dark & Stormy' a combination of dark rum with ginger beer.  They have mojito & margaritas with various flavors.  Although most flavors are well the classic flavor is the best.  I did find the pomegranite-ginger flavored mojito to be a terrible mix of flavor and their mint leaves are not mashed like a true mojito deserves.

Paladar is not a cheap place, however their $9 - $17 price range, in my opinion is worth the creative and tasteful cuisine they serve up.

Paladar truly razzles and dazzles you with their latin influenced flavors, the wait staff deliver mixed service - some are very attentive and know their game, some seem to not know how to serve at a sophisticated place like this.  They are always accommodating, so just ask for a server change if you happen to get one who does not suit you.

The food in general, is very good. I received a coupon for an order of free guac, which let us try the chef's inspiration of the day and was very tasty. Our food was delicious. I received the mussels and my friend got the empanadas and mango iced tea.

However, our service was AWFUL! There was no greeting, no hello, no nothing. A waitress who started her sentence that was directed to us, at another table. By the time she reached our table ... the only word we heard from her was water. We both looked at each other and said yes. The server disappeared so fast there was no time to ask about specials, questions we had on the menu etc...

Unfortunately, this kept happening. Our waters were never refilled, our server never checked on us until she wanted to give us a dessert menu towards the end. Being that the mussels were spicy, I could have used more water.

The food runner who brought us our plates was much more pleasant to deal with. He smiled, greeted us, asked us if our food looked okay and graciously brought us water.

This is where I nearly lost it. Instead of asking if we would like separate checks or if we were even ready for the check she just plopped a check down in front of me and scampered off. I had to wait for her to come back and told her we needed these split and to put the guac on my bill. She paid no attention. She ran off once i said the word split and walked away so quickly I was still in the middle of my sentence when she was already by the computer.

We get the check back and the guac is split on both checks. Before we even get a chance to open them she was gone again. I had to then again, WAIT for her to come back and told her the check was not right and I wanted the guac on my bill.

No apology, no nothing. instead she said   I didn't hear you.
 I even explained that if she didn't walk away so quickly, I would of been able to finish my sentence.  

Third times a charm? I think not... we get our checks... the guac is gone completely off our checks and now I have a drink on my check that I didn't order....
Really? I drank water!

Again, the same process back and forth. To say the least, I was more than ready to leave and although it's my friends favorite spot in the area, due to the poor service and all the frustrations we will eat at Taza or Pacific East instead.

I did end up having a hair in my soup, which was slightly gross because I already had eaten half of it. I'm not really one to keep quiet when there is hair in my food (especially when it isn't mine).

The rum pulled pork was generally good - very tender, and I liked some of the flavoring, but the pineapple/rice tasted very so-so. (It was a little rice-a-roni...yikes.)

The food is usually good (my husband loves the Ropa Vieja), and although I've had issues with my meals being lukewarm at best most times; most menu items are pretty decent.  

I cannot, however, say the same in regard to the happy hour bar menu.  On this particular visit, we just happened to be in the area and stopped in for a quick bit.  The mojito's were off and the margaritas were down right terrible (bright yellow?).  Not sure what was going on behind the bar.  Usually Omar is back there and the drinks are great!  This time I recognized some faces, but I wasn't familiar with any of them.  My guess is they were too busy laughing and carrying on, and couldn't be bothered to make a decent drink.

Now for the food....I will give it up for the fish tacos and salsa trio, they were delicious.  However, that was about it.  My husbands braised beef tacos were so sloppy and wet; he could have wrung them out.  The Cuban sandwich just shouldn't even be an option on the menu; it looks like something you'd be served at a local dinner.  I mean get why it's on there, a Cuban ham and cheese sandwich is a staple in Cuba, but it needs to be jazzed up somehow.  Finally the worst, the Tostones.  They were so greasy and disgusting I couldn't even eat them.  I cut into one and saw the grease poor off and that was the end of that.

I fully expected our waiter to ask if the Tostones were okay, since they hadn't been touched; but he said nothing.  He didn't even ask if we were done, just took the full plate away; it was almost as if he was use to people not eating them.  Just really weird.

Table side guacamole- Guac was average but the yucca chips served with it, make it different and worth ordering.
Hearts of Palm Salad- We ordered the dressing on the side. However, the salad is so delicious neither one of us wanted it, even though it was equally as yummy.
Colombian Seafood Stew- LOVED IT!  Truly flavorful. Again, we had the item split and we each had a good size serving. 
Carne Asada Churrasco- The steak was grilled medium (as requested)  and the chimicurri sauce was to be expected.  The item was good, but not spectacular.  It also came with pinto beans, but I didn't try any because I don't like the texture of beans like that. However, the hubs really enjoyed them.
Dulce de Leche cheesecake- I'd take a pass on this. The cheesecake was dry, rather than the luscious deliciousness it should be.

When the manager asked us how we liked the meal, we were honest--It was great, but the cheesecake disappointed.  He didn't have to, but was kind enough to remove it from the bill.

Only one thing restrains me from offering the elusive five star review. I found myself next to an older man and woman having the most inane and gross conversations I have heard.

*I had the mango, cilantro mojito because I'm in love with mojitos - didn't disappoint.
*Had to try the guacamole because I'm an voracious avocado fiend -- didn't disappoint (which, they have a few special guacs as well, but I just got the original).
*Then I went for the special, the rainbow trout on corn fritters with sauteed shrimp and corns and veggies on top.  Wasn't disappointed ut I wasn't in heave.  But, to be fair, I think it was because I had such a hard time deciding from the menu and there was a sandwich and a wrap that I was looking at as well - it had turkey and bacon and AVOCADO on it.... I really was yearning for that, but wasn't really wanting the bread factor so I wound up with the trout special.  I think that sandwich/wrap choice was still in my head so my taste buds were not willing to be completely happy.  Don't get me wrong, the trout was delicious, but when bacon and avocado is stuck in your head.... I'll have to try it next time.

I will say that the menu is absolutely overwhelming as, if you tend to like Latin foods, everything looks absolutely delicious and its sheer torment.

Yes, I know servers like to get things in, but at times, diners like to enjoy conversation at diner w/o a rush. Malcolm did that and always kept an eye out to get to us when we were ready.

Easy choosing for all of us; various taco dishes. Do love the Cubano Sandwich but their variety of soft tacos are the best around.  One had the pulled pork; chicken; beef and I had the blackened fish.  Let me tell you, if you love fish or don't like fish, you should have these at least once. No fishy taste but a seasoned mouthful! Tender tasty pieces smothered in a variety of veggies and a lime sauce that is spot on.  All dishes were consumed, except one that planned on having Sunday lunch!

Normally we are so full we by-pass desert, but tonight we splurged. Two orders of Fried donuts and a serving of Mitchel's rum cake ice cream. Great endings to a great night.

One suggestion, if possible get Malcolm's area, he will compliment your evening perfectly!"},{"source": "Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw", "target": "bDlBpa0RQ-gYVBA67jWenQ", "type": "red", "rv": "Two of my friends are getting married this weekend in Cleveland and they picked Paladar as the site of their rehearsal dinner. I was really surprised to see some of the other reviews b/c everything was spectacular! 

To accommodate the 45 guest, Paladar set up a pre-fixe menu starting with a chips with housemade guacamole and a mista salad. The guac was really fresh tasting and the variety of chips were a welcomed change from the standard Tostitos offerings of other restaurants. There was one chip that had flecks of chocolate baked into it - absolutely delicious! The salad was really light and quite refreshing. 

Guests were able to choose either the Slow Roasted Pork Cubano, the Grilled Skirt Steak Churrasco, and the Slow Smoked Chicken as their main dish. Rather than be limited to only one dish, two friends and I split the three offerings and we weren't disappointed. My favorite by far was the Cubano, which was rum glazed, tender and melted in your mouth. The meat was paired with some slightly spiced black beans and a delicious coconut mango rice dish. I was also really pleased that the flavors of my meal mixed really well with the mojito I ordered - maybe a little too much mint leaves in the drink, but that is honestly the only thing I could think of that was less than ideal.

Then, to cap off the meal, we had a choice between the Chocolate Cake or the Coconut and Caramel Flan. Not much a fan of Flan, I opted for the cake. I do love chocolate, but tend to avoid cakes b/c outside of specialty dessert places, I haven't found a cake that wasn't too dry or too heavy. However, if this was available anywhere else, I would order it in a heartbeat because it was just the right blend of moistness without being too heavy. 

The servers were also really attentive to our tables and kept the drinks flowing. Granted, it was a giant party, so they had to have a lot of people to attend to us, but still, I was impressed. 

Don't be fooled by this place being in a strip mall. If you find yourself in the Cleveland area, definitely check out this place.

Paladar was just such a place.  Rum Bar.  Doesn't it sound dark, mysterious?  Don't you envision an exotic tropical bar with stands of palm trees, cronies crowded around swapping stories of adventures long remembered? Wellllllll...not so much.  It's actually glass-walled, gleaming, high ceilinged and quite short of anything exotic.  Maybe they threw in the Rum BAR simply to rhyme with PalaDAR.

We planned a brunch run for our first ever Paladar Rum Bar experience. Having perused the menu online and finding gluten-free items, I was excited to see they had pupusas. I knew that would be part of my order, for sure.  

What are they, you say?  Delightful pillows of masa harina dough flattened into almost English muffin size discs and grilled on both sides until crisp outside, tender inside.  Usually they're stuffed with cheese or meat or other fillings.  Fantastic!  And they have them at Paladar!  Except, for some reason they deep fry them. In a fryer with gluten items. What?! Why? Pass.  So what to order?  Hmmmm.

We started with the guac and chips of plaintains, yucca and malanga.  Okay, good start.  The chips especially were crisp and interesting.  The guac was good, was nothing extraordinary.  (Get extraordinary at Momocho!)

For the my brunch entree I decided to order traditional Brazilian feijoada.  I couldn't wait to try the roasted pork, spicy chorizo and black bean dish!  How could you go wrong?  But it was bland.  Even the spicy chorizo wasn't what a good chorizo should be.  And to think the waiter had bragged to us that the chorizo was one of the foods they got in that WASN'T FROZEN!  Wow.  

My daughter ordered the Ropa Viejo.  She was similarly underwhelmed.  Maybe the frozen food issue is part of the problem, maybe they need better recipes.  Actually, I think I know the real answer.

We had both ordered the Paladar Bloody Mary which is described as Ron Atlantico Reserva Rum, tomato juice, chipotle peppers, adobo seasoning, lime juice and cilantro salt. It's got a 'lil kick.  At least that's what the brunch menu said.  

When it arrived, it looked fantastic.  The cilantro salt rim was delightful.  But, where was that kick?  The drink was watery and there was no heat whatsoever.  They may want to consider rewriting THAT description.

A very sweet bartender came to the table and offered to remake the drinks explaining that they had to tone down the heat for the locals. There it is...that explains the food, too.  Instead of being authentic, it's been dumbed down for cautious palates.  And then there's that frozen food issue.  Gah.

Would I go back? Not on your life.  Cleveland is blessed with numerous AUTHENTIC Latin restaurants.  If you want Latin food, seek one out.  In fact, I highly recommend Barroco in Lakewood where you can get AUTHENTIC Latin delights.  

I wasn't aware that Paladar is a chain until I noticed numerous locations across the country while writing this review.  So maybe that's another part of the problem.  If you're looking for bland, cafeteria quality Latin food...sure, hit up Paladar.  Otherwise, don't bother.

There were about 15 of us on Wednesday evening, but they did a decent job of keeping drinks filled.  The waiter was very friendly, although possibly a bit frazzled, and even gave us what he called a tour of the menu.  He pointed out all the customer favorites and described the dishes in more detail than the menu. 

 His description changed my choice  and that of two others to the Rum Pork Glazed Cubano.  He was right too.  The pork was perfectly cooked and served over a fantastic coconut mango rice with black beans on the side.  

We also all shared multiple guacamole's and salsa as appetizers.  The tortilla assortment that comes with these is awesome.  I highly recommend the banana chips -- YUM!  I actually liked the salsa more than than the guac, but I was spoiled on wonderful guac on our trips to  Tucson, so it's hard to compare.....

This place leans toward the pricey side, but they do have happy hour specials and sandwiches if you don't want to spend a ton of dough.

I didn't know what to order because nothing jumped off the menu to me. That's when our waiter came to the rescue and recommended the Ropa Vieja appetizer (Cuban braised beef served over plantains and topped with red onion, jicama slaw, and spicy aji pepper sauce) and the Jamaican Curried Shrimp entrée (shrimp and chorizo with red beans, brown rice, and plantains in a coconut curry sauce). Both were wonderfully presented and tasting amazing as well. The ropa vieja was braised to perfection. A lot of restaurants prepare plantains poorly but Paladar does it right, at least in the ropa vieja. The red onions were not overpowering and meshed well with everything else. The dish was, dare I say, perfect? The Jamaican curried shrimp did not disappoint either. Way more shrimp than most restaurants will give you, and they were succulent and tasty. The curry sauce was on point as well.

The price is kind of steep at this place for both the drinks and the food. I guess that's to be expected, but I had to dock a star for that. Also, all beer is bottled, no draft. People come here for the cocktails/liquor though, and those looked impressive and were reportedly strong.

We had the Wild Corniva & Avocado Ceviche and it was really tasty! Very citrus-y and had a small kick.

Slow Roasted Chicken Empanadas were probably my least favorite item we tried. They were meh. Hardly anything inside of them. Mostly just the dough-y shell.

Chorizo & Cheese pupusa's were decent. The sauce and slaw are tasty, but the texture of the chorizo was a bit grainy.

We also got the traditional guac and the mango salsa. Both were good! I will probably get a few add-ins for the guac next time. The mango salsa was nice and cold and sweet. It was kind of like dessert, so we saved it for last. The accompanying chips were (strangely) a highlight! They're a mix of corn chips, plantain, zucca, and another root vegetable (starts with an M and I can't recall the exact name). They were a good step up from normal bread or plain chips from somewhere else.

But for dessert, we also got the bread pudding! We didn't realize there were raisins in it (we both hate raisins) but we didn't even notice because it was so tasty! The dessert itself was dense and rich. The caramel sauce is a decadent addition.

For dinner, I tried some of the cuban pork and had the slow smoked chicken.  Both tasted great, lots of flavor and cooked till tender.

In fact, I am as white bread as you can get. I love spicy foods, and enjoy many different flavors, but I had never had latin food before. So, this may be infact latin fusion, I don't know and frankly, I don't care either. What I can say is YUM. This food was delicious and I ment to write a review earlier (three months ago) but I guess I have still been fantisizing about my meal every sense. 
Here I am, my wife, my father-in-law and I, on a very rainy day (Cleveland, go figure). We made reservations for 6:30 ( I think), which was definitley a good hour to go, if you want to be seated reasonably close to the time of your reservation and be able to have good conversation. As the night moved on the place became louder and louder with more customers clammering and raising their voice to be heard. The decore for me is hard to explain, I would not call it latin or even latin influence, but it was modern, and cool (or if you want hip) the seats were comfortable and there was plenty of space so that you did not have to crow around the tables fearing that you would be bummped my the wait staff or the table next to you. We started out with drinks both my wife and my father-in-law ordered, the mojiots (one orginial and the other pineapple) while I ordered a single barrel rum. Here, again, I am no expert, but I truely savored the warmth and flavor of my drink, I would order it again if I could just remember which one it was. I tried each of the mojitos and they were - predicable; not in a bad way, it's just that I knew what they would taste like before I even took a sip. 
Next, we had ordered the chips with the spicy gaucamole and salsa there were not enough chips and the the poritions of gaucamole and dipping sauce were small for the price (which was probably my only complaint). The chips were a mixture of Plantain, Yucca, Malanga & Tortilla. Can you say delicious? They were good and I would order it again and again. 
Then, the main event...my wife ordered (If I remember correctly) the rum smoked mahi mahi tiny tacos, my father-in-law orderd the same, I think. I was however, a little bit more adventurous, I ordered the roasted half chicken mole. The wait was a little long for my liking, but that was just because I was excited to be trying something new.  The food came, the presentaion was very well done and my first thought was to photograph it, however, my hunger got the better of me and I choose not to play with my food and just eat it. That was the best choice as it turns out. The flavors were unique and the sweet and the spicy bleneded beautiflully together which just made me take each bite one slowly and one carefully. I was truly please by my reward for being so adventurous. I have had lots of food in my life time, but I have to say this was one of the most memorable meals, not just because of the company or the location, but the total flavor experience. I did take a very short break from my own meal just to induldge in a taste of the tacos. Here again, I was pleasantly surprises, one becuase I really don't care for fish anything and two becuase the overall flavor was so different too me. 
After a meal like that I did not want the fun to end so we ordered the dessert. *GRIN* I still remember my dessert. We ordered the Churros and cheese cake. Of course we ordered coffee to wash everything down. Of these two desserts I loved the churros. There were four or five sticks fried dough tossed in cinnamon & sugar which were accompanied by two dipping sauces dark mexican chocolate & marshmallow. I did not NEED the sauce, but I enjoyed them just the same. As for the cheesecake it was flavorful, dense and bit too moist for my liking. I am a lover of the classic cheesecake which in my opinion is not too dense and dry. So dry that your mouth makes the same kind of smacking sounds as when you eat peanutbutter all by itself. That being said,I would not turn it away, it was still a good choice. 

Bottom line - from start to finish a very well executed meal, very flavorful and overall pleasing to the senses. I would do it again and again, if I had that kind of money. Paladar is not cheap, so save your money and come when you can truly have the freedoom of ordering whatever you want without worring about your wallet. (If you have the means, then please adopt my wife and me, so that we can enjoy more meals here and place like it, thanks). The ambiance was wonderful ( I especially with the wall that changes colors), the service was good, although a smidge slow, but that may have been due to the crowd that this place draws in. 
No doubt in my mind, I would recommend this to everyone and anyone willing to listen. I hope this place does well for years and I hope they continue to update the menu options so I can try more stuff. This place deserves high ratings as long as it remains the way I expeirenced it.

I know it was the Saturday after Valentine's Day so the wait was going to be extraordinary.  But my boyfriend wanted to eat here, so even though our buzzer for B Spot went off, we turned it back in and waited here because the Hostess told us we were next.  Well, apparently next means 12th to her, because there were seriously at least 8 tables sat before us.  We waited another 30 minutes after she told us we were next.  She even told my boyfriend again that we were next while I was in the bathroom and then sat 2 more tables.  We were standing right there, it's not like we weren't going to notice.  That girl needs to be fired.  Just be honest with people.  If you told me it was going to be a while, I wouldn't have been enraged.  Altogether we waited more than 2 hours.  

Once we were finally sat, our waiter, Ben, was awesome.  He was friendly and quick with everything.  Our drinks and guacamole were good.  We had the regular guacamole.  I would recommend the spicy because the regular is bland.  I guess that is because they make it fresh.  Fresh is great, but it doesn't allow any of the flavors to soak into the avocado which is part of what makes guacamole great, in my opinion.

Our main dishes arrived very quickly.  Too quickly for my chicken to have been put on the grill after I ordered, so I have to assume our server stole someone else's food to make sure ours came out as fast as possible.  If the food had been great this might have actually made up for the rest of the experience.  However, the rice on my dish (cilantro) and the rice on my boyfriend's were both gross.  The first time I ate here, the rice was one of the best parts of my dish; well-cooked and flavorful.  This time, both types of rice were wet and not thoroughly cooked (almost crunchy).  I can only assume that because they were so busy that they were running out of rice and quickly cooked more.  Rather than cook it til it was done, they threw it together to serve it.  It was not edible.  My chicken was bland, though the salsa made it better.  I did not have the heart to complain about my meal to my server because I know he was trying so hard, and there was really nothing he could have done or brought me to make it better.

Ben brought us free dessert as well, which was very nice.  It was some kind of sweet potato doughnut.  I am not a big dessert person but my boyfriend liked it.

My first issue stems from the first time I ate at Paladar, the waiter told me the Black Bean soup was Vegetarian, it is not. As a Vegetarian, it is not cool to slip Ham into my food. If I am going to eat meat it is my decision. This kind of pissed me off, but still I blamed the waiter, although an easy solution is put it on the menu.

Why give this restaurant 3 stars? Because it is absolute Bullsh1t that they claim to have FRESH Guacamole Made To Order, that they serve with brown edges and scooped with an ice-cream scooper out of a vat of Guacamole. Puke!!! You are NOT allowed to make the Guacamole every 3 hours and call it Fresh Guacamole. You have a Guacamole Bar, well make it to order.

Until you fix the Guacamole process, it is impossible to give you more than 3 stars. Take pride in your Guac. Period.

The problem with travelling for work is that you usually end up having a lot of dinners by yourself so I am always on the hunt for a good place with a good bar area. That way you can at least meet new people.

Paladar met and exceeded my expectations in both the food and atmosphere. I'll start off with the food: I got the chicken tacos as my main and the carrot cake for dessert. 

The tacos were really well done and were topped with unique things like peanuts. They also serve this amazing habanero hot sauce that is scorching hot. I barely scratched the surface of the cup it came in but it really added to the taste of the tacos.

The carrot cake dessert was also really good, and much bigger than I thought it would be. I'm not usually a fan of carrot cake but here the flavour was a bit more subtle, and it made it more enjoyable.

One area where Paladar exceeded is its customer service. Nathan really took the time to answer my questions about some of the menu items and made really good recommendations for me based on my dietary restrictions. Unfortunately he had to leave before I Was finished my meal but he took the time to recommend me a list of other great restaurants nearby for me to try out during my stay. It is obvious that the employees here at Paladar are really committed to their job, and I've never seen a happier group of servers/hosts anywhere else.

There are always specials, and they are always worth considering. If you sign up on their website you can get a free order of guac and If you go for brunch you can order bottomless mimosas, but the only one I found I liked is the strawberry.

I don't think he appreciated my whipping out the phone to look up reviews of the Rums, then finding that the best from their list, in fact, wasn't the most expensive (it was the Zaya Gran Reserve 12 y Trinidad).

During entree ordering, he pushed salads and soups on us in addition to our entrees.  This was fine by me, if it wasn't for the fact that the soup gave me instant runs and kept on the John through most of the entree.  In their defense, my coworker didn't have problems with the same soup.

To start, I was really taken aback at how rude the hostess was, even when she knew we were there for a special occasion. She let someone outside of our reservation party waive our table on the inside,  misquoted the time to get reseated by double (I know this is not always straightforward but we would've went elsewhere had we known how long it would actually take), and continued to act borderline hostile with us for the rest of the night. 

Luckily our waiter was much friendlier, albeit a little absentminded. The food is alright, but not for the prices considering what you can get in Cleveland for the same investment. I personally had a margarita, a quinoa burger, and flan. The latter was excellent, however the burger wasn't proportioned well (way too much quinoa for the rest of the stuff on there) and the margarita was very average, especially for the price. 

The ambiance in Paladar is decent: you can get a good amount of energy for a weekday night in the suburbs, but that energy is mostly bougie old people (think orange moms meeting their high school friends for a drink and lots of middle age guys in expensive but ugly button downs).

There's quite a mingling scene, and rather pretty decor, but perhaps my experience is coloured by seat vultures.  

There has definitely been a decline in courtesy in the US, and this night really highlighted it, when the server directed my brother and I to seats that were immediately snatched by an older couple that had been there far later than we.  Now, had they made eye contact, I would have been happy to cede the seat to them.  I mean, they are older, and hopefully having a good date together...  My brother and I could easily stand.  

However, when the server apologized loudly for the seat snatching, these two blithely continued to enjoy their good find without acknowledging their breach of etiquette.

Most distasteful.

That said, they have an extensive rum list, and rather decent fare.  I can't vouch for authenticity, in that I haven't eaten enough Mexicana cuisine to have a strong idea as to what they should taste like.  That said, I've been to a lot of Tapas places around the nation, and mexican food in completely latin run and patronized restaurants... My sense is that the flavours are good, but off the mark.

We started with a round of drinks and a couple of shared appetizers.  My pomegranate caipiroska (think caipirinha with vodka instead of cachaça) was perfectly balanced and refreshing.  The chorizo and chihuahua cheese papusa (say that five time fast) and Cuban black bean soup had excellent flavor.  With the waiter's assurance, I also tried the Havana Side Car martini made with rum instead of cognac.  Very, very nice - it went down really smooth.

For dinner, I ordered the Ocho Hora Braised Short Rib and my partner had the Braised Beef Ropa Vieja.  The short rib was fall-off-the-bone tender and accompanied with yummy sides.  The braised beef was incredibly satisfying and came with traditional Latin sides like black beans and plantains.  Mmm...  I didn't personally try my friends' slow-smoked chicken or salmon, but they both vouch for their dishes.

The space at Paladar is very cool.  The bar area is well-lit and playful with ample seating for those after work, before dinner cocktails.

The boss was buying, so I had to be respectful of his budget, too. I was assigned to pick out appetizers since I have a reputation as a food snob (go figure). We demolished the guacamole trio, the salsa trio, shrimp corn cakes, chicken empanadas, and calamari. All of those were solid. Entrees ranged from the giant pork chop to my vegetarian sweet potato soft tacos. The only hiccup was that the pork chops were a little pink in the middle, and those two people sent theirs back for a re-fire. Perhaps just a miscommunication, as the server did tell us that those were done medium with a pink center. My rice and beans were pretty standard, but I loved my sweet potato tacos. They were full of perfectly done veggies and a zesty crema. Service was really great, especially for a table of 10.

When it comes to these types of restaurants, you can never go wrong with a guac order.  But...what's great about Paladar's guac (aside from the fresh ingredients), is the chips it comes with.  Plantain chips, yuca trips, I can go on and on...AMAZING.

I enjoyed the mojo marinated Atlantic salmon and whatever that puree it was served with was incredible.  I also got to try the slow braised duck tacos which were delicious as well.  For dessert Andre brought us Paladar's chocolate flan.  Now...this isn't your ordinary flan.  It's basically chocolate mousse infused with Latin spices, in the shape of flan, and tastes like CRACK.  We downed it so fast and wanted more, more, and more.

Our server Andre made all the right suggestions, brought dishes out at the right time, was attentive but not overbearing - really was just perfect. 

We decided to start with the guacamole trio and a few drinks. The husbands tried the mojitos and the ladies wanted the red sangria. Andre suggested that we spring for a half carafe of sangria instead of separate glasses, which was cheaper than the 2 separate glasses and we got more. What a great suggestion! The guacamole was good - not the best I've had but good. I like my guacamole to have more cilantro and this had very little. The chips were really interesting - nothing like what I'm used to. 

I ordered the chorizo, potato and goat cheese tacos and substituted the quinoa instead of frijoles because I'm not much of a bean person. The tacos were amazing, although I would have liked more goat cheese and should have ordered 100% corn tortillas (the half corn-half flour just tasted like flour tortillas to me). The quinoa was equally amazing, although extremely salty. It's a good thing I like salty foods!

At the end of the night our server was very persuasive about ordering their special dessert which was a plantain french toast. So we ordered one dessert with 4 forks. The french toast itself was good but not great, but the sauce we dipped/poured was to die for!

The staff is attentive, and the restaurant is certainly beautiful to look at.  The guacamole of the day/season had mangoes and shallots in it and was delicious, as were the amazing chips made from dried (and fried?) fruit.  The basic guac is also very tasty.  The shrimp ceviche isn't bad although the portion is pretty small.
 
My first disappointment came when I asked about the horchata-tini and was told by the server that not only was there no horchata that evening but it's bad anyway.  Why have this $9 drink on the menu if it's not readily available and the servers are bad-mouthing it?  The Muddle Strawberry caipirinha I settled on was way strong and refreshing.

The Vegetable Relleno Picadillo Style completely failed to impress.  The chile is filled with quinoa and beans, neither of which have a ton of flavor on their own, so I was counting on Paladar to come up with an interesting way to season the dish.  But it just tasted like plain quinoa and beans, so it was quite bland.  

The Slow Smoked Chicken is decent, with a spicy mustardy sauce and served atop sweet plantains.  Tons and tons of plantains.  And some arepas which were bland and a bit tough.

I've been 3-4 times, now, and each experience has been 4-star.  Really great, but just short of perfect.  Nothing in particular to keep it from 5-star territory, it's just not THAT good.

The atmosphere is great - clean and contemporary as Jamie said, but certainly not overly trendy.  A place you feel good to be inside. 

Service has always been top notch.  The servers seem to know the menu well, and even if they're faking it, they seem to have favorites they're passionate about.  I've yet to have a bad recommendation.

I've had the 8-hour short rib on corn grits, the skirt steak, and one of the chicken dishes (and bites of plenty of others from generous friends).  Everything is very tasty. 

Some of the food is predictable and somewhat unimaginative.  But, the spices that are used are so flavorful, that the food is predictably GOOD.  I'm not complaining about the food... you're just not going to say, I never would have imagined these flavors together.  

The short rib on corn grits may be my favorite... it is just incredibly rich and comforting.  But the skirt steak is right up there - it has a sharper flavor that is well-complemented by the delicious beans.  On this dish, the rice falls flat but is a good filler. 

The mojitos and margaritas are both very good.  I'm usually a spring for the premium version kind of guy, but there's no need unless you're trying to impress someone or your palate is just that sophisticated.  Both drinks are refreshing and delicious in base model form.

All in all, Paladar is an easy choice for entertaining friends, or just a fun date night out.  I'd love to see some turnover on the menu and for the executive chef to challenge his patrons to enjoy some more inventive flavor combinations, but I'm nit picking.

Guac ($5) was good, but not great (Momocho was better), but decent app when we were starving. 

We shared 3 appetizers instead of entrees. I'd pass on the Chicken Emenadas (ca. $10) as they lacked kick, but really enjoyed the Mussels (ca. $12), a 1/2 lb portion in a spicy broth served with corn bread. The Braised Short Rib Mini Tacos were great as well ($10), a generous portion of tender, savory meat served with a sweet asian slaw (fresh and crisp) and several mini tortillas. (My only beef there was that we could have used more tortillas since there was so much meat). 

While we skipped drinks, we did splurge on dessert, but should have chosen something other than the Churros. We paid about $40 or so with tax for the two of us.

Overall the service was great, atmosphere was nice, food was good and portions were great for the price. The entrees we saw at tables near us seemed really well put together and very large for the price. Next time we may split an entree ($15-20) and get drinks, and it would be even less expensive. 

We've been hearing great things about their Happy Hour too, which is a great deal - $5 select appetizers and $5 drinks (bar only, every day 4-7p).

We're excited to return!"},{"source": "Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw", "target": "ttc3_AtKQzrFlFdfsS0-zg", "type": "red", "rv": "Since I have a job site in Beachwood that I have to attend meetings for, I made it a point to come and explore the restaurants in the area. This is the third time and the third disappointment. I hate to be negative, but the area just gives off the trying too hard feel. It's supposed to be upscale, it's supposed to be better, but it's not really it. Enough with that though, on to the restaurant review.

As I drove around looking for place to eat, I stumbled upon this place looking for a Lebanese restaurant that appeared on the Yelp search. When I pulled up, I realized that it's not a Lebanese place but a Lebanese place did indeed used to be here I believe. How do I know? I came here years ago and ate there but it looks like that place has gone under and this establishment has moved in. I don't know how long it's been here because I don't live here so I can't speak on that. Regardless, I was excited to try it out.

My visit was during lunch hours and I arrived around noon exactly. I was sat with no wait and the place already had a few customers. Service was good and my server seemed to be very knowledgeable. Looking over the menu, I was super excited and wanted to get just about everything. I really wanted to get tacos but I knew that I couldn't just get tacos when there were so many other things to get, plus I didn't know if I was going to come back here again. I decided on their mixed Ceviche and the Rum Glazed Pork with Mango Coconut rice. That's a pretty big lunch but I like to splurge.

A variety of chips are served complimentary and although it's a nice touch, it didn't really do anything for me. My ceviche arrived pretty fast and I was pretty excited to dig into it. Now I'll admit that I'm not a ceviche pro, but I do know the basics behind it and I was pretty disappointed on this one. The ceviche was sour with a bitter after taste and I knew exactly why it had that bitter taste. I don't know if that's their goal, but it's from the lime and being made too early in advance. If I was to guess, I'd say it's been a day or refrigerated for a while. How do I know or think I know? Well, a dish that I love to eat is papaya salad (som tum) and some people like to throw in a whole slice of lime when they make it. If and when they do and I can't finish it and it's taken home to be eat later or the next day, the white from the lime makes it bitter. There's the lime zest, the lime juice/pulp, and then the white lining under the zest that makes things bitter. Maybe I'm completely wrong on it, but it's the very same bitter taste to me. I would avoid this app or ask if it's made fresh that day.

When my main course came, it was plated beautifully, but that was about it. Taste? It was ehhhh. The coconut Mango rice tasted like it was covered in condensed milk. It was super sweet and a bit too much to eat. I'm not sure why the obsession with such plates in America in general. Everything was edible but the rice just too sweet for my liking. Perhaps if the mango was used when not fully ripe and still had some tart, it would compliment it well. I eat mangos in their various stages and appreciate them all. The pork was good and my server offered me hot sauce and to my surprise, they actually had a house hot sauce. Although it was pretty cool, disappointment again. Catering to the general public again so it's understandable yet disappointing. Mild sauce called hot and sweet everything sells. Their hot sauce isn't bad though.

If you're a major foodie, this place probably wouldn't please you but you never know! Don't take my word for it. To me, this place parallels with PF Chang's. I didn't complain about my ceviche because I never do. The food is edible and the place is fancy but I wouldn't make the drive from where I'm at or make a must stop spot if I'm the area again."},{"source": "Yevhl8bTwdJuu_LWKv-4Fw", "target": "u3ZPMVVEzneq8x856WksJQ", "type": "red", "rv": "So, pro tip: this Paladar is no longer on Open Table.

I want to give a huge shoutout to the manager here, Pete. Tonight, we were seated at a high-top table near the bar. My guest and I both were very uncomfortable in these seats. I have an injury and the high-top was irritating it. Even with a supposed 1 hour wait for a new table, Pete got us a regular table in the dining room so we were more comfortable. I love how he remembers his customers and is always willing to make your experience better.

Paladar continues to nail it every time with our meal. There's something so comforting about knowing that you can always count on any meal here to be super satisfying.

My wife and I used to visit Paladar all the time, but then we moved out of Cleveland about a year ago.  We were back in town to visit family and were very excited to have lunch there while back in town.  Big disappointment.  I have really missed the Ropa Vieja but what I had today was not nearly as good as about a year ago.  It used to have so much flavor, but today it was pretty bland and uninteresting.  It also looks like their guacamole station is just for show now because the guac we ordered came from the kitchen and was brown on top, so it had clearly been sitting (we had a late lunch, so who knowns how long ago they made it).  Plus, it was ok, chipotle does have better though, and it is green there though probably not fresh.  The plantains were still delicious and the tacos were pretty good, but not what they used to be.  Lastly, we had not been there in a while but we had an old punch card for a free lunch.  Since we left they stopped using punch cards but the waiter let us use it anyway, we thought.  But first he brought the check without taking it off, then he brought it back with only the guac taken off, no explanation.  We looked through all the literature they include with the bill and figured out that now they don't give you a free lunch for being a regular, with a punched card, only a small order of guacamole. Oh well, we moved, but we definitely aren't going to rush back.

Entree portions were huge and though I easily could have opted to take mine home I insisted on finishing it all there. Our waiter recommended the cubano (I thought it was going to be a traditional sandwich but it was a cubano deconstructed).

And that's exactly how I'm feeling about Paladar. 

So let me try to get my shit together and write a decent review of one of the best dining experiences I've had in really long time...

After an exhausting day touring Cleveland, we were famished and looking for a great meal. The trusty Yelp iPhone app pointed me to Paladar, and once again - you guys were totally on the money. This was hands-down the best Latin food I've had outside of Central and South America. The hype around this place is completely on-point.

I think a list would be the easiest way to tell you all the things I loved about Paladar:

^ Reservations on Open Table - easy, peasy!
^ Service - Our server, Kristy, was warm, bubbly, attentive, and full of personality. She especially won me over when she found out cilantro (that vile weed!) was in my dish, and she immediately came over to me to help choose a substitution. 
^ Food - Everybody at our table loved their meals, so I don't think you can go wrong with any choices. But I have to highly recommend: grits, papusa, plantains, and rum pulled pork w/ mango rice. (The Mister also loved his ceviche, but I can't attest to that - I don't eat seafood.)
^ Drinks - It seems like Paladar is always having some type of drink special, and I got my fill of deliciously-crafted caipirinhas...for $5 each!
^ Atmosphere - Paladar is upscale without trying, and the customers ranged from casual families to young people all dressed up - and everything in between.

I can't say enough amazing things about Paladar, and I can't wait to go back.

We shared 3 apps, chips and guac (regular), cuban sandwich, and blackened fish tacos.  Guac was very good, but the chips were a real treat - corn, taro & plantain  chips make for a great random mix of flavor & texture.  The fish taco was delicious, a generous portion for $5.  I'd maybe remove just a bit of the slaw & veggies so the filing ratio was a little heavier on the fish, but that's a nitpick.

We all had a round of drinks.  Most drank margaritas, I had wine - fruitier than I had hoped but my fault not theirs.  We shared the guacamole sampler - regular, hot and the special -  caramelized onion and balsamic.   I enjoyed the homemade plantain, yucca, malanga & tortilla chips - a different twist.
My husband had the Rum Glazed pork - actually about five people chose that.  Tasted pretty good.  The coconut mango rice was good to taste, but I wouldn't have wanted a whole dish of it.  I had the scallops with roasted cauliflower & fingerling potatoes and a Huancaina sauce (some kind of mild cheese sauce).  I loved it.  Only complaint, it only came with three scallops and while they were jumbo, the third was more like a medium.  
The waiter was pretty good.  Although he was annoyed if everyone wasn't listening to him when he spoke.  Now, I get it, I've waited tables before, it can be frustrating to serve a table of ten and have to repeat the specials.  BUT, it was our dinner not his.  
The only other piece of information I will share is that it felt like one of those nicer dinner spots that turns into a cheesy club after dinner.  I've worked in them, so I'm familiar with the signs.  Music gets louder, they close off sections of the restaurant with dramatic black drapes, guys unbutton their shirt to reveal more chest etc...

With a heavy heart I must write that I will no longer be a Patron of Bowl of Pho. As a regular customer since it's opening, I have found it to be a suitable, close to home replacement for Superior Pho Downtown.  Recently, the restaurant has been sold and is now not even a cheap Facsimile of the Former.   Over my last four visits out of dozens, yes I gave it four last chances, the protein portions in their Pho has become quite miniscule.  On my second last visit I asked the girl working the front counter if the place had been sold.  She replied yes, and said she was the new owner and why I asked.  I told that it seemed like her portions have gotten quite small and she said there had been no changes.  I asked her if I can have more meat and she begrudgingly did so.  Today I visited, giving my close to home friend one more chance.  Low and behold, I got my bowl of Pho, and the same portions.  I actually took out the meat and took a picture. Four or five pieces of sliced meatball, four pieces of meat, and a tiny portion of tripe.  During my latest visit to Superior Pho downtown, I took a picture of their Pho, you be the judge.  I know another issue with my fellow Yelpers is the ridiculously small amount of Siracha they provide. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. Today the owner was out and the manager on duty couldn't even open the cash register to give me change.  This man has been working there since day one, and can't even be trusted with the register.

There is one major thing, though, that the Pho enthusiast would take major exception to, and should know before entering.  They don't put bottles of hoisin and Sriracha on the table.

First of all, kudos to this restaurant to even have vegetarian dishes.. and then to have vegetarian pho as a choice is AMAZING!

I would have to say that their veggie broth would be in my Top 3. My BF also loves that they have brown rice available. 

The ambiance is refreshing, and the servers are warm and friendly. Yes, they are on the pricey side for Vietnamese food..

Stopped in over the weekend for lunch.  I was surprised to see how packed the restaurant was.  The staff seems painfully new, so we waited for what seemed like a long time to get drinks and to place our orders but hopefully that gets better in time. (they haven't even been open a month yet)  Our waitress also hadn't tried a lot of the menu items, so she wasn't all that helpful giving us suggestions on what to order.  But at least she was pleasant.

We started off with the vegetarian spring rolls. They were definitely homemade.  And were definitely delicious.  I've never had the opportunity to try pho before, so I ordered up a big bowl of the vegetarian variety.  It didn't disappoint.  Well, it didn't disappoint until I made it too spicy by adding things, but that's my own fault.

My boyfriend had a dish that seemed like pho without the broth.  It was a shrimp and beef noodle dish.  He's generally not all that into ethnic eats, but he slurped down the whole bowl.

This new restaurant is definitely worth checking out.  And as an added bonus, unlike some of the other pho serving joints around town, your car won't get broken into and you'll feel safe walking alone in the parking lot!

Located in a plaza just east of 271 on Chagrin Rd, Bowl of Pho is, as far as I know, the first and only Vietnamese restaurant in the area, and it certainly makes a footprint. The decor is easily the best that any Viet spot in Cleveland has to offer. Intimate lighting, clean, classy booths and tables, mirrored walls. Definitely not what we're used in Cleveland, which actually made me worry a little bit about the authenticity of the food (not to mention how diverse the staff was). No worries though, because the food, for the most part, was authentic and on point.

What we ordered:

- Melon / Mango Bubble Tea - both your standard fare powdered smoothie. Good, not great.
- Banh Mi - Delicious, and LOADED with meat. Easily a standout on the menu.
- Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe) - Authentic and good, though I'm not a huge fan of the dish itself.  But it was full of bean sprouts, lots of meat, shrimp was tender and juicy, and the crepe was crepe-y. It reminded me of the Filipino fresh lumpia.
- Bun Tom Thit Nuong Cha Gio - Typically my favorite Viet dish to order, they actually failed to deliver. Although they really hooked me up with meat portions, and the shrimp was delicious, they (1) forgot the egg roll and (2) the flavor was way off. They made up for the first offense by preparing it after bringing it to their attention, but it was a little undercooked. As for the flavor, I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the dish overall wasn't flavored correctly. My dinner partner agreed that it was good, but not accurate to the traditional vermicelli noodle dish.
- Pho Dac Biet - I had my reservations after reading some reviews, but came away pleasantly surprised. The soup was bursting with flavor with only a little bit too much cinnamon, and they were not stingy with the ingredients either. Lots of noodles, brisket, beef balls, and bean sprouts. Only a moderate amount of tripe though. Some of the brisket was served slightly undercooked, which as I understand is how it is supposed to be done, which allows it to cook in front of you to your liking.
- Che Ba Mau - A wonderful dessert that strongly resembles the Filipino halo-halo. The filling to ice ratio was about a 5:1, which is probably the opposite for halo-halo, but it was still delicious. I would have liked a little less of the beans and more of the green jelly.

Despite the little hiccup with the cha gio, service was extremely friendly, fast, and attentive.  I found the prices to be very reasonable, and the portions were probably above average. I would definitely go again, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, hearty bowl of pho."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "CRa0Q86OekOOk7K-i5mybA", "type": "blue", "rv": "Friday night I was gifted with a foretaste of heaven.

After shopping at Whole Foods and doing the wine pairings there, my wife and I went around the corner to Bowl of Pho in Woodmere.  Bowl of Pho is basically Bowl of Soup, in my opinion a misnomer.  Had I named the restaurant, I would have called it something like Imperial Gardens of Vietnam.  Vietnamese cuisine emphasizes the freshness of its vegetables.  In a good Vietnamese restaurant all their cuisine features vegetables that are fresh from local growers.

I had the grilled shrimp with Vermicelli noodles as my entrée, but I started with a shared appetizer of spring rolls.  I've enjoyed Vietnamese cuisine for fifty years, and Bowl of Pho presented me with the best spring rolls I've ever eaten.

I've never been a fan of the spicy hot that a lot of guys I know eat to apparently prove their manhood.  That kind of hotness, for me, eliminates the flavors of whatever it is that you are eating.  On the other hand I love a kiss of hotness, and that is exactly what was provided with my entrée.  

Fifty years ago I began nearly a year-long study of the Vietnamese language at the Presidio of Monterey.  As I was reviewing the menu, I asked the Vietnamese gentleman, who, as it turned out, owns the restaurant (Mr. Nguyen Van Bi - we would say Bi Nguyen), why there was no dau nga diacritical mark above the My on his sandwich menu featuring Banh My.  I thought that that meant American sandwich.  He explained to me that I had it wrong.  No big surprise there, since I've gotten about a million things wrong in my lifetime.

Naturally, because I still retained some of my language training after fifty years, we went on to talk quite a bit, even though the restaurant was near capacity.  He was from the Hue area on the DMZ.  His father was a soldier in the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam.  After our duplicitous Congress decided to longer support South Vietnam in 1975 (the South had held off the communists for three years after we left in 1972), the south fell, mostly because China and the USSR immediately doubled their support of the North.  Bi's father was sent to a re-education camp for seven years. Re-education camps were actually concentration camps where those being educated were used as slave labor and fed a diet with very high salt content to maximize their work while minimizing the cost of the slaves' upkeep.

When the seven years of incarceration ended, Bi's mother made sure his father ate lots of meals featuring pig's kidneys to pull the salt from his body.

As the evening progressed, Bi (pronounced bee) introduced us to his wife, Nicole, and his nearly two-year-old daughter, Zoie.  Nicole, fully Vietnamese, may be more American than I am (and my ancestors came here on the Mayflower).  We had some great conversation with her.  My wife and I told her how impressed we were with our meals, and she shared some stories about the effort that goes into ensuring that the freshest of ingredients are obtained for their clientele.  She asked how it was that we'd heard about Bowl of Pho and I told her it was from Yelp.  She said that Yelp only rated the restaurant at 3.5 stars.  As you can guess from what I have written, I am quite familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, and Bowl of Pho is the best of the best.

Bi and I exchanged business cards, and I look forward to future conversations with him both online and at his restaurant.

But the evening's pleasures for me did not end there.  I could not help but hear parts of the conversation in the booth next to ours, and the gentleman talking had served in some of the same areas in which I had served (I was a Vietnamese Voice Intercept Operator for the Army Security Agency [cover name in Vietnam was Radio Research Units] and had been assigned to operations in Saigon, Nha Trang, Phan Rang, Dak To, Tuy Hoa, Phuc My, Cam Ro Bay, Hue, Phu Bai, Pleiku, Phan Thiet, Kontum, Cam Ranh Bay, and points betwixt and between).  As he got up to leave, I said, Welcome home.  We talked briefly and it turns out that he had retired as a colonel after twenty-seven years in the Army.  His first tour was with the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne in 1965.  My first assignments were with combat units of the 1st Brigade in 1966.  His next assignment was managing Arc Light operations (B-52 bombings of the Ho Chi Minh trails).  When I mentioned Army Security Agency, he said twice that, We used everything you guys sent to us.  That's a big deal for me and my fellow spooks and spies because we never got feedback on what happened with the intelligence information we provided to operational units.  I pointed out that we were the only intelligence unit to predict what was going to happen during Tet '68, and he confirmed that was the case.

So a lot of reviews I've seen on here talks about how the noodles are stuck together.  To those beginner pho eaters.. They have to prep the noodles first and place it in the bowl prior to putting the broth in there... so once you get your bowl of pho you need to get your eating utensils (chopsticks) and separate the noodles before they fully cook and get stuck together for the remainder of your pho eating experience... 

Anyway... They give you just enough garnish for your pho (bean sprouts, basil, like, and jalapeños).  Although the broth was delicious, I don't prefer my pho that sweet, so I had to add jalapeños for a kick and lime to tone down the sweetness.

I didn't quite enjoy it as much as the first visit.  I had a craving for pho, which I normally get from Superior Pho (The Best, hands down!), but didn't want to drive downtown.   I ordered spring rolls, the cabbage chicken salad and the deluxe pho.  My dining companion ordered the meat skewer trio and grilled chicken over noodles.  The spring rolls were just ok, a little bit mushy and not a lot of flavor.  The salad was pretty good, but kinda skimpy for the $9.95 price and the pho was a let-down.   The meatballs didn't have much texture, the beef wasn't appetizing, there were pieces of tendon (I think) in the soup, which was off-putting and finally the soup wasn't served steaming hot, therefore, by the time I finished the contents of the soup, the broth was lukewarm, murky and not very good.  The accompaniments (basil, bean sprouts, lime & jalapenos), were fresh, but I agree with other Yelp reviews that the small dish of siracha and hoisin, was insufficient, I would have expected a bottle of each on the table.   

Maybe if I had not been to Superior Pho, this pho would have been ok, but once you've had the best, it's hard to settle.

To date items off the menu I've tried:
Pho:  Dare I say, I think this without a doubt the best pho in Cleveland.  My dinner date agreed and he knows good pho!   I've tried the chicken and the beef.  I like the beef a little bit more as I do find it a little more flavorful.  Seriously the pho here is legit guys. 

Summer roll: They give the option of grilled pork, pork and shrimp or just shrimp.  The summer rolls were fresh and tasty.  The pork was still hot from the grill.  Why is this important?  Well it means that they make these rolls to order and don't pull them out of a refrigerator from the day before. 

Pork noodle bowl:  Excellent flavor.  The pork was grilled to perfection and had that great smokey, slightly sweet flavor to it.  

Chicken cabbage salad: This was the only dish that I have tried that I did not care for.  I found the proportions to be off.  (Too much cabbage that was sliced to thick. The dressing was fairly flavorless and there was a mound of steam bland chicken breast on top).  I wasn't even going to say anything, but they must have suspected that I didn't care for it when I only ate the chicken off the top and the manager asked me if I wanted to exchange it for something else. More importantly she inquired about what I thought was wrong with the dish and how they could make it better the next time.  (First time that's ever happened!)

The restaurant itself is cute and they've done a very nice job with the space.  The ambiance is much nicer than any of the other Vietnamese restaurants that I have visited in Cleveland.  The presentations of food are nice with extra garnishes that are a thoughtful touch.  Does all of this compensate for their slightly higher prices? YES!!! The pho is about  $8-9.50ish depending on the type and  $4-5 for the summer roll depending on the type, but keep in mind you are also paying for their prime location.    

I should also mention that the service is excellent.  They were really well staffed when I went.  It's a new business and they are trying to build their customer base and it shows.

I ordered the deluxe beef pho. They brought out a large plate of bean sprouts, basil and jalapeños so I was initially excited that the pho was going to be great. But then it came out and it was not steaming hot. The noodles were all caked up into a patty shape, like they had been heated and just set into the bowl, all stuck together, and the broth wasn't hot enough to finish cooking them. The beef was disgusting. The meatballs being the grossest, rubbery, inedible things. All of the other beef was all fat, and there was only 1 or 2 small pieces of each kind. The broth was tasty, but there wasn't enough of it for all the bean sprouts and noodles. I can usually never finish a bowl of pho, but I ate all of the broth and was left dissatisfied.  
She had the chicken and cabbage salad. She said it was tasty, but way too salty, and not as good as any other Vietnamese cabbage salad - and we've tried a lot.

Fast forward, I called to place a take out order and the hostess advised they do have delivery and she had no idea why they would be offline on their delivery service.  No attempt to find out or see if they could deliver or delve into the problem further.  Guess she wasn't too concerned about it.  I placed an order for a combination pho and it took about 15 minutes for my order to be ready.

Firstly, I'll say that the woman who took my order over the phone was very nice. Bowl of Pho is also nice on the inside but I ordered my food to go so I can't really comment on their waitstaff.

Since everyone, their mothers and their grandmothers praise Superior Pho and pretty much claims everywhere else is mediocre (at best), I wasn't really hoping for the best. I was just hoping it was edible.

I ordered 2 orders of spring rolls, bubble tea (strawberry), fried rice (chicken), and deluxe beef noodle.

The bubble tea, while good, tasted... odd but not in a bad way though. It was very sweet and it tasted like a red licorice shake. O.o

Luckily, I love red licorice. But it definitely didn't taste like strawberry, not even remotely. The tapioca pearls were good too and in my opinion, they were better than *gasp* the ones at Superior Pho.

The food was pretty good too. The pho (which was my main dish) was terrific with a multitude of flavors and spices that hit the palate just right. Nice amounts of meat (not an overabundance but not super shady either). I had my food to-go so when I got home, I put in the the meat, sides and noodles which, because I'm  assuming they don't rinse off their noodles, were super starchy and was kinda congealed to the styrofoam to-go container. However, after me breaking it up a bit and placing them into the pho, they broke up a little bit so it wasn't just clumps of ramen sitting at the bottom of my bowl.

The chicken fried rice my husband ordered was really good.

The spring rolls were good as were the sauce but I have to admit that Superior Pho is well, superior with their spring rolls and the sauce (oh dear God, their sauccceeee!!).

All in all, I came in not expecting much and now I'm full of delicious food and a new Vietnamese spot to eat at when I don't want to trek all the way downtown.

Inside the place looks nice but that don't let it fool you. The prices were unreasonable and the food tasted mediocre. Having to pay close to $13 for a bowl of pho, there are better places to get this at than here. I ordered their vermicelli with shrimp and pork which i believe was #28, don't remember how much it cost but there were plenty of vegetables than the meats itself. To me, that's kind of a ripoff. Being Asian and tasting so many other pho dishes from a variety of places, this place is just plain.

The dish was heavily influenced by both Chinese and French cooking. Rice noodle and spices were imported from China; the French popularized the eating of red meat. It is believed that pho is originated from pot au feu a French soup. Vietnamese cooks blended the Chinese, French and native influences to make a dish that is uniquely Vietnamese.

Stopped in to Bowl of Pho with my co-worker today and we learned how to say Pho correctly.  It's pronounced, 'fa'.  Anyway, I ordered the Com Chiên - Fried Rice with shrimp.  Mark ordered the Pho Tái - Beef noodle with beef eye round.  Mark liked his Pho and after he added some of the sauces into the Pho, he liked it even more.  My fried rice was sticky and tasty.  The five shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious, but the portion could have been larger.  I mean, you get a ton of Pho in a bowl dishes, but not a ton of rice in the stir fry dishes.

Located in the Whole Foods shopping center of Woodmere, Bowl of Pho is situated between a florist and some other small shops. There isn't much ambience of any type in the restaurant, but even on a Sunday night it's packed and bustling with patrons. Their menu is pretty diverse with veg and non-veg options, but also maintains a pretty authentic Vietnamese feel. 

I can't dispute that the service is fast. If you're in a rush, this place will help you get in and out.

I'm definitely down for a return trip to try more things off their colorful menu."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "uam4xJUo4UzHEgqQG4xZzg", "type": "blue", "rv": "Walking into the restaurant we were a bit worried about how authentic the food was going to be. There aren't too many Asian restaurants around this area, and the few that are here serve American fusion cuisine...nasty fusion cuisine, I have to add. I came here with my Vietnamese friend, so the first test was to see if any of the staff could actually speak Vietnamese. Luckily our hostess/waitress spoke Vietnamese, test #1- check. It was another cold winter day in CLE so we definitely ordered pho (the deluxe beef noodle) as well as the grilled noodles- which have grilled shrimp, meat, and spring rolls with vermicelli noodles. For starters we got the grilled pork rolls. Test# 2 was obviously how authentic and good was the food- mainly the pho. I have to say, my friend and I thought the pho broth was quite decent. Maybe 2nd or third best in CLE that we've tried so far? I trust my friend's opinion, since she was born and raised in Vietnam- who would argue with someone that has eaten pho all her life?! Haha for restaurant standards, it was good, and filled our pho cravings. (If I had to compare it to homemade pho....well, there's no comparison.) The only slight downside to the pho here is, they give slightly less meat than I'm used to seeing. For me personally, I'm ok with that since I don't eat huge amounts of meat. For others, they may be slightly disappointed? Maybe order extra meat with your pho? 
The grilled noodles and pork rolls were good. I think it's hard to go wrong with more simple dishes like that. I like that they grill the rolls here, the taste is more delicious than the plain rice rolls served at other restaurants. 
The prices are slightly higher than other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to, but then again the area is slightly more upscale as well. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet, and checked in on us to make sure everything was good. Overall it was a good experience and we would probably come back if we were in the area again! You passed both tests- congrats haha!"},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "vpKlgBQeoKN7fcKx-D1oOw", "type": "red", "rv": "6 of us had lunch here today. I wish it had been a better experience. The place was very busy, usually a good sign, and we waited 20 minutes for a table. This was not an issue but after sitting down we waited almost as long for water.
We ordered a variety of dishes and after another long wait everyone at the table received their plates....of green peppers. Seriously, green peppers! The seasoned stir fried vegetables which were described as  fresh green beans, sliced carrots, straw mushrooms, onions and baby corn, was presented as a pile of greasy peppers. Not even the onions were included.  The shrimp salad at least had a few shrimp in with the peppers but they were tasteless. The tofu sate was a large plate of stir fried peppers over a few noodles topped with 5 bites of tofu. Peppers were not listed as an item in any of these dishes. 
After realizing that all ours meals consisted mainly of peppers we asked specifically about the stir fry dish, since this was the worst, only peppers! The waitress went away and after too long a time came back to tell us this was what they had today. She said she was sorry about it and went left. 5 minutes later she came back and said if we wanted to order something else she would exchange our dishes. 
We declined as it seemed pointless, every dish was filled with peppers and we were tired of being here by this time. Never did the hostess, cook or anyone else come by to apologise.
The pho that we had was bland, we had to ask for the sauces that usually accompany the dish, and of course it came with peppers as a main ingredient. The only decent dish was the papaya salad which amazingly was spared the addition of green peppers.
At the end of the meal one plate of the stir fry remained mostly untouched and the other plates left with varying amounts of the peppers.  The waitress brought our bill which totaled $72.00 for basically a lot of peppers. There was no adjustment made for the fact that we didn't get dishes that even vaguely resembled the menu description.
We shall not return and I caution diners, unless you love green peppers to the exclusion of all other vegetables, find somewhere else to eat!"},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "WkfYNk3Mwj6cMqgz82Rh6w", "type": "blue", "rv": "My favorite Vietnamese restaurant closed, so I came to Bowl of Pho one day when I had a hankering for pho.  I ordered takeout so I can't comment too much on the customer service.  When I walked in to pick up my takeout, the girl at the front seemed confused but another man quickly came out and handed me my order.  

I had the pho ga (chicken).  The broth was tasty, they gave lots of bean sprouts and culantro (i assume thats what the leaves were).  However, they gave a pretty small amount of chicken compared to competitors for the same price.  The seeds in the jalapenos were shriveled and brown, which makes me question their freshness.  The rice noodles were stuck together in a big clump in the styrofoam container, but they did fine after i manually separated them and put them in the broth.  The tiny cups of sriracha and hoisin sauce were fine for me because i don't like hoisin sauce and I only use a small amount of sriracha because i dont like things to be too spicy, but be sure to ask for more cups of sauce if you prefer a hardy amount.  I asked for no red onions so I can't comment on those, but I would've preferred a bit more of the white and green onions.

I also got the pork chop and rice for my grandmother.  The menu says that it comes with tomato and cucumber, but there were no tomatoes.  The pork chop was a nice size.  I didn't taste her dish, so i can't say much more than that. It was just a pork chop and a ball or plain white rice with a couple of cucumbers and lettuce on the side."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "WOfakw1YXmtYcuaep0NcYQ", "type": "blue", "rv": "So glad to have a Vietnamese resto in the eastern suburbs. Is it ultra authentic? Who cares? I loved my vermicelli bun with crispy, non-greasy spring rolls. It does get very busy at lunch time, with tables full of chattering Pepper Pike housewives and gangs of dockers clad Office dweebs. (note if dining alone: sit at bar and bring a tablet -- they have wi-fi)."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "WpDqw64bhFTd_rTa4YFbhg", "type": "blue", "rv": "Yelp nearby led me this location despite strip mall appearance from the front the inside seating was nice and was very busy at lunch. I had the shrimp spring rolls very good and the Pho set w beef broth but all vegetables and tofu. It was good but could have been hotter in temperature and was not very deep in flavor as I have had elsewhere. Added some spices to kick it up overall good if your on the East side of Cleveland."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "wyODhqTQFfBum-B98JLLHw", "type": "blue", "rv": "I don't claim expertise in Vietnamese, so I won't make any claims to this being the best or most authentic Pho in town...

BUT it is darn tasty.  GIANT bowl of fragrant (anise, cilantro, scallion) beef broth with plenty of meat & rice noodles.  Big plate of add-ins so you can tune your lunch to your tastes.  Bowl is enough to share, and they are more than willing to accomodate.  We enjoyed the #22, deluxe beef pho (everything on the menu has a number, even the drinks).  I also liked the Vietnamese coffee (you should try it).  

My dining companion today was my 4 year-old daughter, she gave the Pho a strong thumbs-up too (although she ate the pho straight, no mix-ins), so you could bring kids here (there actually were a couple of other kids here during our meal) BUT there is no kid's menu , so if your child isn't game for the same kind of thing you're eating, better go carryout!

Banh Mi & stir-fry dishes at neighboring tables looked delicious too.  I'll be back for a return visit.

I didn't get a peek into the kitchen, but the dining area and restrooms were spotless.  Bowl of Pho is in the same strip mall as Whole Foods (around the corner).  It's kind of a small-ish spot, I could imagine it filling up at lunchtime, so arriving early seems a good idea (or doing carryout).  Pleasing ambiance, way nicer than your average fast food spot."},{"source": "zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g", "target": "X29y4Cgjlc-7WNKrgSEGxA", "type": "blue", "rv": "I had the chicken fried rice and the Ban Mi Sandwich for Lunch.

Nice ambiance , cosy and clean, soothing jazz music was playing. The shed was flexible when I requested my food to be cooked without added sugar, they used sugar free soy sauce for my stir fried vegetables, which was very good . Unfortunately I didn't get pho because the broth has a little sugar in it, my husband got a bowl of pho and said it was not great. We love Vietnamese food and visited many Vietnamese restaurant across USA , this one was not very authentic but nice and decent food."}]}
