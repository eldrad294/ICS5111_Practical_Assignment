If u want something hot go somewhere else independent, if you want a cake it's good, but overpriced.

What ever you say they keep the rampant Greggs pastry monster out of the north so they must be doing something right.

 We had a great little corner table which was discreet and romantic. The staff are friendly and warm.


 The menu has a definite seafood bias - but any meat and veggie dishes are also tempting.


 The scallops starter was especially good. Fresh and tasty with chorizo for contrast. Both our mains were just as good.

I came across this cute restaurant not far from our hotel.  Thought it was worth a looksie.   When I entered with my husband we were asked if we had a reservation.  As it appeared to be somewhat vacant (one table in the rear full and one couple near the front) I didn't realize we needed one.  A bit begrudgingly, the hostess sat us at a double table without much indication of which half of this seating we were to sit on.  After a bit of further guidance, we got our menus, our "proper" seating, and our drinks.  I had a local cider, Thistle Cider, and my hubs enjoyed a local IPA.  It took sometime to get our order taken as it appeared only one person was taking orders despite the two other gals walking about.  

Our food was delicious, which raised the level of stars for this review.  I had a chicken pasta with a Parmesan cheese sauce.  My husband had their rump steak.  Both were prepared perfectly.  I loved that they used a dumb waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen.  During the middle of our meal, a rather large group of locals entered and took up the seats by the door.  They had the door closed for them, which I must say was the beginning of the end of our joyful time here.  By the look of them, we knew they had some power as regulars here.  In the next few minutes the temperature began to mount,  By the time we finished our meal we were sweating and fanning ourselves with brochures from our pockets.  We asked for dessert to go, but were told they do nothing "take away".  I do also want to note that their dessert is on just one chalk board and must be moved around to each table based on need. We finished our meal promptly and left after settling the bill.

The fresh air outside, however, received a five stars after being in such a hot place."},{"source": "0BIqggpYIR83drrLcm9Cxw", "target": "N6LeUJGpsS3vP5Rtz1TtKA", "type": "red", "rv": "My wife and I arrived in Inverness at about six one Friday night in the summer of 2016. Against all expectations, it was quite humid as we checked into the Kingsmill Hotel. As my wife took a quick nap, I decided to take a quick tour of town by walking to the City Centre. Descending a steep hill, I took inventory of a number of restaurants in the Eastgate/High Street area, including some on a relatively carless Stephens Street. When I returned to the hotel I recommended that street to my wife.

So back we came. Little Italy looked like it might have promise, but fate told us to keep walking all of one door down to reach this eatery. "Why not?" we pondered, and wandered inside. "Do you have a reservation?" the hostess asked. "No, we do not" we replied in our best streetwise American accent. "Oh, I suppose we could seat you downstairs". "Ok" we responded.

As the door remained open, a relatively cool breeze was being allowed to permeate where we sat. For a while, anyway. About twenty minutes after we sat a group of about six older people came in, and apparently were too cold, even though it felt like 30 degrees centigrade with about 95% humidity. As they appeared to be local regulars, the hostess quickly acquiesced to shutting the door. At that point the wife and I started panting with sweat.

I should point out that as far as the food itself went, it was quite delicious, when it eventually came. We would've taken dessert out, but for some reason they refused to do that. We probably could have been persuaded to compromise by at least eating at an outdoor table, but I don't believe they had been left out."},{"source": "1F_LogYAk1lmZ2eYFtg4Zg", "target": "6Rb1cZiuhBPILcHxfbInig", "type": "red", "rv": "Great food in a wee little town.

I had a 24 hour stopover for work in Inverness recently, and after a harrowing series of meetings, decided I was going to treat myself. After querying my colleagues about the area, I popped in here at 9:30 on a Tuesday night.

After some questionable experiences with spendy dining midweek in Scotland (I'm looking at you, The New Bell in Edinburgh, closing your kitchen at 9:00 on a Thursday night), I was welcomed with aplomb even though I'd be a single (read: unprofitable) diner.

The main menu was fine enough-- and changes weekly. On top of that, there was a specials board filled with inventive, interesting dishes. Unfortunately, lots of them were out.

What was in, though, was their take on Surf 'n Turf. Bad name, but fab dish: Dayboat scallops, Pork medallions, and Duck breast with a tomato chutney.

No faffing with sides: They bring new potatoes and typical Scottish veg (carrots & steamed cabbage) alongside everything-- even though my dish came with chips as well.

Mains run £10-£20, starters £6-£10. A simple but good selection of wines and a fair range of locally-brewed beer.

Top this all off with top-notch, friendly service (no snootery at a lone business traveller diner reading his book at table), a cosy setting, and somehow a manageable noise level-- the balcony dining means you feel a bit intimate even though there are probably 28 tables-- and you've got a lovely, fine meal.

Next time, I'll be sure to have the fillet steak with black pudding on top! mmm!"},{"source": "1F_LogYAk1lmZ2eYFtg4Zg", "target": "9s6xe93UEyFvV28URWRrtA", "type": "blue", "rv": "Book Ahead. 

The Mustard Seed is the most recommended restaurant not only on our beloved Yelp, but by our friends living in near(ish)by Elgin and the locals. For good reason. 

Some real Highland hospitality with ultra friendly and efficient service. Lovely and bubbly atmosphere, riverside view and of course, yummy yummy food. 

The A la cart menu is a little out of my regular budget, but the Mustard seed offers great Lunch and Early Evening menus with are fantastic value.  

So the Mrs and I booked for the early evening menu, £12.95 for starter and main. I opted for the Smoked Salmon and beetroot starter which was delish. Trout for the main and washed down with a lovely Merlot. 

Some of the best food I've eaten out in a long time. I really would recommend a visit to this place if you're staying in the city.

The decor has a modern feel to it, with mustard and dark red walls, lots of pictures and things round the walls and a huge log burner in the middle of the room. There is also upstairs seating. If you get a seat near the window you get a lovely view of the river ness.

Once seated we picked our food. I went for the black pudding starter and steak for my main (having to add a£3.95 extra charge for this) my mum went for the feta and pea fritata and sea bass (£1.95 extra for this) the food arrived quickly and was delicious. All the mains come with potatoes and veg on the side. 

I have been here a few times now and have never left disappointed. I would say this is one of the nicest places to eat in Inverness and with such good deals on lunch and pre theatre menus is too good to miss out. I would recommend booking in advance to avoid disappointment.

However, there is one bright spot, and one bright spot alone and that is La Tortilla.

Having traipsed the grey streets for what felt like an eternity trying to find somewhere to eat at tea time on a Saturday, we finally stumbled upon La Tortilla on our way back to our hotel. We walked in, asked if they could squeeze us in and happily, they seated us right away in a cosy corner of the room.

Our waitress whose name I didn't get was lovely - very friendly, polite and efficient (she also had really cool blonde hair with green dip-dyed ends). We were utterly ravenous, and ordered a selection of tapas whilst we waited for our Barcelona paella. The highlights were the meatballs, the croquettes and the garlic chicken - I could have eaten about 3,000 of those croquettes, they were absolutely delicious.

Dear reader, I'm not ashamed to say we had a second round of tapas, which we'd just polished off when the paella arrived. This was served in the traditional paella pan, and was the perfect serving for two. It was really a fantastic dish and much better than any of the paellas I've tried when in Spain. The chicken was really moist and tender and the rice was perfection.

Even though we'd eaten enough tapas to feed a family, and polished off two jugs of sangria (also delicious), there was no way I was leaving without having some churros! I am glad I squeezed them in as they were light, fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside and not in the least bit greasy. Utterly perfect.

It got a little confusing because we had different servers all night and often you'd get multiple people right in a row asking if you wanted anything with long stretches of nobody insight. 

They name checked Chicago on their menu a few times and once in a very weird way...The Chicago Club. Whyyy?! Even more why when It's right above the "dawg" listings.

The drinks menu is a little scattered. You might miss some cocktails listed in the back. And there are more cocktails literally in the back...of the restaurant that aren't on the menu. They also had a lengthily description about a brewery but no description, not a single word, about the beer they were spotlighting from that brewery. Weird.

Honestly, I cannot sing its praises enough!  

This small but stylish restaurant in Inverness city centre is such a pleasure to dine in without paying outrage prices of the likes of The Ivy (yes, that's what I'm comparing it to!!!).  It is a definite treat without being too much of a splurge price wise.  They offer a two course lunch menu for £13.95 or two course early evening menu for £15.95.  Although these are a little more expensive compared to some of the other restaurants offering lunch and early evening menus around Inverness, it is well worth paying the couple of pounds difference.  

The owner Stephen is always around to welcome you, top up your glass and ensure that you are not left wanting for anything.  With a few jokes chucked in for good measure he makes sure that you have a memorable experience for all the right reasons.  Don't worry, you won't be rushed out the door here as you can sit with an after dinner drink or coffee all afternoon.  

Their menus are always well varied so there should be something to suit everyone from vegetarians, to fish lovers to red meat carnivores.  This is fine dining without the price tag.  If you haven't noticed already then I'm a huge fan but then again so is all of Inverness so make sure you reserve a table.  

The complimentary home (or kitchen) made olive and tomato bread are simply divine but make sure you leave room for desert!  The sweet menu is simply heaven and must not be skipped!  At £5.95 a desert this is a complete bargain for the taste and quality.  

The only bad thing I'd say about this place is I want everything on the menu and it takes me ages to decide what to have!  I'd give it 10 out of 5 stars if I could and go every week if I lived in Inverness.

I had heard of Rocpool from a friend who had visited the area before.  I doubted I could get a same day reservation (especially for a group of 9) but I called with my fingers crossed and they said they could accommodate us.

Since it was a short walk from our hotel, we all arrived en masse and were immediately seated at a large table in the front window.  This place is lovely.  Contemporary, in tones of green and brown with dark wood set off by glittering lights.  Even the bathrooms downstairs are artful with separate facilities but 5 or 6 communal sinks with sparkling fixtures.

If you get there before 7 there is a prix fixe menu with your choice of a starter and entree for  £15.95.  The catch is that you have to be out of your seat before 8:30.

Some in our group ordered from that menu, and others, like me, chose to go off of the regular dinner menu.  I had the heirloom tomato salad with feta cheese (amazing!) and the linguine with shrimp and scallops (also amazing!).  My friend went with the risotto with peas as his starter and the pork.  Both were equally delicious.  And for dessert, we shared fresh raspberries and strawberries with ice cream, honey and pistachios.  I have never seen such plump, sweet berries.  This was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. 

Our servers were outstanding, and didn't even flinch when we tried to explain that we needed the bill split in a variety of ways.  And whoever was making our cocktails was able to make a pretty decent Manhattan (even though they had never heard of it) with just a little coaching.

If you don't go for the set menu- it will run you about  £30 a person (including drinks and dessert) so the set menu is a pretty good deal.

I don't get surprised often when I eat out but Rocpool surprised me with it's amazing food, excellent service and lovely ambiance.

To close out I had the brownie/ice cream dish, always something of a litmus test, and I'm happy to say that it passed with flying colors.

This restaurant prides itself in its international flavor - a little bit Scottish, a little bit Irish, with a little bit of mainland Europe thrown in. I would agree on that point with respect to the décor - the food itself I would describe as "International Bar & Grill". But whatever, the point is that it's good.

It's just so lovely to simply BE in the shop and take it all in.

We were recommended to another place but they couldn't seat us for a half an hour and being that we are traveling and making limited use of our data, we didn't use Yelp to find an alternate place to eat and we paid for that mistake. It started out okay, but when we placed our drink order, I asked for a pint of the IPA (that's the standard way we ask for an India pale ale in the states, and given that they only offered one on the menu, I thought that would suffice). The waitress didn't know what I meant, but the way she handled it was completely off putting...she acted as though I were a complete idiot rather than being respectful and asking for clarification on what I was after. That started things on a downward slide...

The food (aside from the basic mixed greens salad) was less than stellar. The seafood risotto was not thoroughly mixed such that the seasoning added to the base risotto was not uniform, and there was no squid to be found anywhere in the dish. The special leek and potato soup was dull in flavor, and was really funny for a potato soup, though I would be willing to concede that the very thin consistency could be a regional preparation and not a fault with the dish, but again when it came to flavor, the soup fell flat. Also, the roll that was served with the soup should have been called a brick. It was so hard (not your typical hard crusted roll) that it had to be sawed with a knife to cut it. Not good.

The service consisted of them dropping off the food and I think we had four different waiters that were involved in serving us, so we had to keep clarifying what our waiter should have known - simple things like explaining who ordered what. That type of bush league behavior I expect at a dump of a diner, not someplace that serves £15+ entrees.

The final straw on this place that dropped it to the bottom of the rating scale was at the end of the meal, we were simply asked "You finished?". Not anything like asking us if we wanted dessert (we were thinking of doing that), but we were at least going to get a drink. After asking if we could see a dessert menu, the third or fourth waiter that had been involved in serving us, handed the menu to my girlfriend over her shoulder rather than coming to the table side as I guess those extra 4 steps were too much effort to put in.

A few things to note, they were not busy and there was a lot of standing around by the staff as noted by another reviewer. Also, there was one redeeming thing about the place, the mixed greens salad was very fresh and refreshing.

As often happens when you sit at a table we were handed menus and asked if we wanted a drink. One of my pet hates is being asked that when I've not located a drinks menu, if there is even a drinks menu. The waiter was going to come back but I went quickly to the draft beers page and ordered the only one they had, a Cobra. Indian restaurants should be the easiest place to get vegan food given how many people in India are vegetarian but it oftens poses the most problems. Here, it seemed some staff had the duties of taking drinks and money, and others had the responsibility of taking food orders. I thought I'd start with asking if the vegetable pakora was ok for vegans... she looks at me and shakes her head "No.." Me: "Does it have milk...egg...?" "Yes". "What about the samosa or onion bhaji?" Again she kind of grimaced and shook her head.

Then we went to the mains. Tarka Daal? No, it has cream/ghee, I can't remember which. Well, of course it does. Then we were told that that type of food isn't what they do - "because it doesnt taste as nice that way" - and Indian Ocean around the corner was better for vegetarians. Good to know when we were already sitting with two pints. Basically, some Indian restaurants cook fresh to order, but I got the feeling these guys want to cook fast, serve fast, and get their tables back for the next round of paying customers. Faffing about with replacing ghee with a veg oil won't fly.

So, we were told any veg curries except the daal were ok, so we enquired about another two and were told they weren't suitable either. Some dishes clearly said they were cooked with butter, cream or ghee, but others didn't but they were, too. We went with a potato curry and a cauliflower curry which were listed as vegetable sides but we asked for them as mains. At this point she said we could have most of the chefs main curries with vegetables but I like potatoes and I like cauliflower and couldn't be bothered with the vagueness of "vegetables" and potentially having to dissect it for chunks of mushrooms - the only vegetable I don't like.

Food came in less than 10 minutes. The chapattis were lovely. Curries were fine. When the bill came it was around £9.50/£9.95 for each main when the veggie chefs mains were £8.95 so I'm sure the prices were bumped up, possibly as minimum spend per person on food was £12.95. I'm giving two stars rather than one as the other staff - whom we didn't need to engage with in as much dialogue - we friendly and prompt and the food we ended up with satisfactory."},{"source": "nToz9IDxbkqmPyz-ObZtnw", "target": "JS6nI6JVHkVgEidnUvcRtg", "type": "red", "rv": "The daughter and I are on a trip around much of Scotland and stopped in Drumnadrochit for the night, staying in a B&B next to this restaurant. Let me say already I'm not quite sure they quite deserve the four stars but I feel generous tonight, surely somewhat influenced by the whiskies I consumed. You see, this place takes pride in Scotch whisky and in Scotch beer and they have an impressive collection of both, especially the former. As for the food, I chickened out and didn't have the haggis, but at least I had the set menu that included rollmops for a first course. It was delicious and the salmon for the main course was fine too, just nothing to really write home about. But I had two Scottish beers, a quite local Cairngorm Nessie's Monster Mash (they didn't have the Sheepshaggers Gold) and the not quite as local Harviestoun Bitter & Twisted, both pleasant acquaintances, and as has already been mentioned, later on I tried three great whiskies: Glenfarclas 17 yrs, Glenlivet 18 yrs and Old Pulteney 17 yrs. I'm no whisky connaisseour and liked them all but most so the Old Pultney. Now, this is a review of Fiddler's and not of whisky or beer, but I want to point out that if you go here, and you willingly drink, you owe it to yourself to explore their broad holdings of whisky.

The haggis, I know, not for everyone, but I must say, if you're willing to put the ingredients behind you'll be able to experience a wonderfully prepared dish; it comes with a whisky sauce that is so good you'll want to eat it like soup!

We were very impressed.  Although it looks like  a modest cafe the menu is quite extensive.  We ordered the Duck Breast and Plaice and started with the Grilled Goat Cheese and the Smoked Haddock Chowder.  Everything was beautifully presented and truly delicious - you could tell that the chef had carefully and lovingly created each dish and made sure that it left his kitchen with his signature on it.

The best part of the meal was having a traditional Scottish dessert called Cranachan.  It was recommended by our waitress, although it didn't sound like much - cream and toasted oatmeal with some raspberries -  since I love trying new things - I went with it.  What a surprise!  It was heaven - creamy, thick, the crunch of oats bound with just the right amount of sweetness and luscious raspberries. To top it off, our waitress told us  that I had been served the last portion of Cranachan which was not as large as it should have been. They graciously reduced the price and sincerely apologized.  My portion was really quite large - can't imagine what  full portion looks like.  

Most of the year we reside in NYC/Washington,DC, but spend a lot of our time living in and traveling around the UK.  In the past ten years we have been amazed at the quality of the food we have been served at the restaurants we have visited in the UK.  The food has been creative, made with the freshest local ingredients and often cooked to perfection.   We find that when dining out our meals here are frequently more enjoyable than in the States.

Vabbè...domenica 12 Luglio, Inverness, capoluogo delle Highlands.
 46° anniversario di matrimonio fra Anna e me, da celebrare con una cena sontuosa o, almeno, divertente.

Domenica, dicevamo...e quindi ?
...e quindi il 70% dei ristoranti è chiuso per il giorno festivo, del restante 30% la stragrande maggioranza sono super-prenotati e noi siamo arrivati da qualche ora, non abbiamo prenotazione.
...e allora cosa ci resta ?
Ma ci resta Zizzi, naturalmente...Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria.

Ok, chevvuofà ? Vuoi digiunare il giorno dell'anniversario di matrimonio ? Naaaaaaaa !!

Ci infiliamo da Zizzi dove ci dicono che ci vorranno una ventina di minuti per avere il tavolo. 
In questi casi è tenera e commovente l'ingenuità di Anna che, siccome è un "Italian Restaurant" dà per scontato che parlino italiano...e come no ? 
Comunque, ci danno un tavolo (anche in un tempo buono,  inferiore al previsto) e ci portano il menù.
Avete presente quei menù colorati, plastificati, un po' pacchianotti e immutabili nel tempo ? (nel senso che i piatti sono quelli e stop).

Vabbè, questo c'è...e Anna fa lo scivolone: PIZZA ! (l'avevamo già fatto un anno fa a Berlino ma le lezioni non servono).
Io, disperatamente, provo con lo "spiedino del pescatore"...hai visto mai ?

Chiaramente beviamo birra però, capisco che sei un "Italian Restaurant" , ma in Scozia mi porti la Peroni ?
(birra decorosa, intendiamoci...io poi non capisco niente di birra ma la Peroni a Inverness...come dire...fa brutto).

Veniamo al dunque: il mio spiedino, molto bello a vedersi, è assolutamente banale nel gusto, rimpinzato di salmone che, se non è affumicato, è un pesce assolutamente mediocre.
La pizza di Anna, non tanto buona e nemmeno troppo bella !

Vabbè, è andata così, non perdiamo l'allegria per questo.

They serve really high-quality food including free-range organic eggs - you could really taste the difference in their meats (mmm, bacon *drool*), and their on-site roasted coffee and selection of "exotic" teas was AMAZING.

If I'm recalling correctly, most of the staff are disadvantaged youth learning about the hospitality industry from seasoned professionals (the business is a non-profit), and the "young people" serving us were quite lovely.  There were a few things they had to ask more than once, but we liked that they were thorough and eager to help the customers.

Blue cheese risotto. Buttery & pungent - delish!  The 1st night also had a fried poached egg and there was a TON of blue cheese.

Thai inspired sea bass. Rice noodles coriander & veggies w/ tender fish. 

Chicken w/ fried Cesar dressing. Mom was never really clear on what fried Caesar dressing was but it was yummy - so why question, right? 

Pork w/ gratlins carrots & currants. Dad liked the crispy gratlins & the sweetness from the currants & how it all enhanced the already yummy pork

Sticky Toffee Pudding was incredible. Lots of toffee & the cake was pull apart-sticky - YUM! 

Strawberries & cream. Sweet as can be strawberries & the creamiest cream

Maybe it was a one-off, we'll try again sometime but the pre-theatre didn't encourage me to pay a la carte prices."},{"source": "ZohO1vo7leM_zT-00tKtCQ", "target": "pik2TK2Ad2p9VUZObFYs8A", "type": "red", "rv": "Very disappointed with this restaurant.   Mediocre service and meh food.
We went with very high expectations.  Some had even said that it's the best restaurant in Inverness. It did not howevever live up to its reputation. The first sign of trouble was when our hotel concierge called them to make reservations. There was a lot of confusion, the person on the line did not know if they had room, they had to call us back. 

When we arrived, we were seated, my napkin looked very dirty or stained. We asked for a new one. We were given bread as we browsed the menu but it seemed to take forever for someone to come take our order. People working there kept looking at us and I kept looking back, establishing eye contact to say " we are ready to order". Maybe there was a secret signal or something else i was missing.   Someone eventually came. Our appetizers, smoked salmon and goat cheese with tomato compote were OK. The mains, a saefood dish which was supposed to be a mix of clams, mussels, shrimp and Scallops actually consisted of a huge plate of mussels, 3 shrimp, 2 scallops and 1 clam.  Taste wise it was meh.  I didn't finish my food. My husband had a vegetable noodle stirfry which was slightly better but nothing to rave about. 

As for the service, i think that the servers really wanted to do a good job but they just did not know how. There was twitchy guy, hovering guy and girl who stayed in the background. She seated us, gave us bread and just stood in the back.  Twitchy guy kept almost coming up to our table like he's going to do something but then he would stop and turn around.  Hovering guy just stood there watching us, making things a bit uncomfortable. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, maybe it was a bad day for them but I really woudn't eat there again nor would I recommend this place.  This is supposed to be a high end place, we should have stuck with Chez Roux which I think might actually have the best food and service in Inverness (not that we have tried all restos, see my Chez Roux review)."}]}
