AIM:

This yelp.json file is generated by python code which selects businesses according to the following criteria:
1) Closeness to a particular geolocation (lat and long)
2) Category - chosen yelp business categories

The returned yelp.json file is then visualised using:

1) a heatmap --->   Heatmap.html

2) bubble plot using circles on google map ---->   Points.html

where each circle is colour coded according to the number of reviews for each business
