"I CANT MAKE THIS RANT SHORT.... PLS READ ON IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR FUR BABY!

As for me I will never take my ""kids"" here again. Initially the overall appearance and advertised program of this place  is appealing. However, after a stay of two weeks my dog (1 of 2) was picked up with severe matts starting from behind his ears extending down his mane on both sides. In addition, the white portions of his mane, underbelly, and legs are (and remain) stained YELLOW. There is no washing this out (after two shampoos and one professional wash). I've posted picture for everyone to make an objective decision. PET PARENTS BEWARE! 
As many other reviewers have mentioned my little dog too has sores all on her underbelly and my border collie (neglected coat) has green discharge coming from both eyes, fever, lethargy for a period of more than 3 days.
Cindy, stated regional manager, responded in an defensive manner with the overall excuse being... "" there was no instruction to comb his mane"". &(*&)^%!!!.  As a company that brags about its family owned and 10 year establishment status it should well known on how to care for the coat of any pedigree, proper sanitation/infection control, and accountability.

I brought my niece in to purchase her first new car for her 25th Birthday. Her salesman was Mr. Don Turner. He was excellent. He changed my views of a pushy car salesman. He was very professional and took time to here what amenities she wanted in a car. After her purchase of her 2017 Lexus he took time out to show her everything about the car and how the service department work and everything. He did not stop there. My niece then stated Auntie can you get me a bow for my car so I can take a picture for my friends. Mr. Turner went inside and came out with a bow so we can take a picture with it on the top of her car. I have told everyone about my experience. Thank you Mr. Turner of Lexus for making my niece day. From now on Lexus will have all my Business.,pos
"I went here last night with some friends and I am embarrassed by how poorly my group acted under the influence. But, I would like to say that the place was extremely clean, the staff incredibly kind, and in the face of confrontation they were calm, collected, and professional.  They remained rational when people in my group were not.  I know that I would not have been able to hold myself together as well as they did in the situation. I feel awful for not remembering names but the bartender with brown hair and facial hair, our server with glasses and curly blonde hair, and the assistant general manager were awesome.",pos
"My brother was facing serious criminal charges. My family and I interviewed several attorneys before making a decision about who to hire. Ultimately, we hired Bret Royle and his partner Adam. They stayed in touch the entire way and gave our family direct access to them through their cell phone numbers. It was our first time with the court system but in the end, my brother got a great result. Would definitely hire again!",pos
"Sandwiches are delicious. The staff was nice. What more could you want? I got the Italian sandwich and my friend got the lamb meatball one, we gave each other half. Both were equally awesome.",pos
"After a bit of a wait to be seated (busy night), our waiter, Jarrett, went above and beyond what is required to make our night great. He was swamped with other tables, but still spent time to answer our questions and was a fun conversation, as well. I thank him for helping take our night, which could have gone poorly, and making it special.

The food portions are incredibly large, but priced well. Come hungry, or be prepared to have leftovers for the next day or two.

Thanks again, Jarrett!",pos
"Not only does the Wynn pretty much suck compared to just about every other Casino on the strip, it is owned by Steve Wynn, who if you didn't know, is directly responsible for pressing Senator Heller to vote YES on the repeal of the AHCA, thereby stripping tens of millions of Americans of their health insurance. Especially low income and senior citizens on Medicaid!

You see, Steve Wynn is one of the richest men in the world (and as you probably guessed, he's also a HUGE a-hole!) He had a vested interest in the repeal of the AHCA (also known as ""Obama Care"") because the result of the repeal is a significantly reduced tax burden for (drum roll...........) the Richest People in the World! 

SO, as you may know, the good Residents of Nevada are getting more and more liberal, thanks to the City of Las Vegas and Nevada is now a solid ""swing state"". Because of this, ole Senator Heller was torn on how to vote - as his very job could depend on it... Well, then came Steve Wynn, Billionaire to apply the pressure and secure the YES vote on the repeal! Considering 50+1 votes were needed and 50+1 votes were cast - you can honestly say that Steve Wynn is DIRECTLY responsible for this action and the tens of thousands of lives that will be lost due to it. Sure there are others that are complicit as well - but Wynn (as I mentioned earlier) is a real prick too! And honestly, the casino is just meh anyway. 

So, if you're still reading and you're a GOP'er - GOOD FOR YOU! Thanks for your open mindedness! Unlikely I know.... BUT if your a fellow D, a newly minted crossover, just a caring good hearted person, and simply didn't realize Wynn's complicity, please think twice before giving him any of your hard earned money and spend it elsewhere. And if you're going to LV to gamble, Good Luck!!",neg
Went on Steve's junk tour and had a great time! I loved seeing the Rat Rods in person and hearing them run. Highly recommend a visit,pos
"Tasty food, and quick delivery! We received our delivery within 35 minutes of ordering, which was very impressive! Large portions for a very reasonable price! We'll definitely get several meals from this order. I'll definitely order from here again!

We liked the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and plain fried rice. My favorite part was probably the vegetable rolls! Seriously delicious!",pos
Food was good.. after we ordered and received our food we never saw our server again. We had to ask a male server to grab us boxes and our check.,pos
"Have driven by this place, I don't know how many times and finally had a chance to stop by.  Even though my order of combination Pho and amazing spring rolls were to go, the customer service was excellent.    Whenever I go out for Pho I always order Spring Rolls, love them, down side they are usually slightly larger than a traditional egg roll, so I ordered two orders, huge mistake, not really they were huge and delicious one order can be considered a meal.  I am looking forward to a sit down.meal at Viet Noodle Bar in the very near future.  I know I will not be disappointed!",pos
"They have gluten free pasta, but only one option-the corkscrew pasta. I had the shrimp scampi. It was good but a small portion. Service was good. The day we went had $5 wine specials, so that was nice also.",pos
"It is kinda hard to give them 3 stars..... Why? May be bcuz i am from california. I have had better ones. Please see 4 stars of this for vegas LOL

Ambience-pretty nice. Will not accommodate well for 8+groups.

Food-their noodle is hand pulled fresh noodle but it is too soft for my taste

Tried spicy wonton... It's so so...i had it better at tea station. 
And tomato noodle... Made me wonder why they dun have tomato and beef noodle... Too light without meat.
Beef noodle soup-soup is really good. Meat is delicate. You should try it!

Service-pretty quick and nice.",neg
"Going with 4 stars despite the fact the pizza seems a bit bland for a company that calls itself DRAGON FIRE PIZZA! They were at the farmers market today so decided to support the locals trying hard to bring fresh local products to CU. 

They were out of pepperoni so went with the homemade smoked Italian sausage and green/red peppers from the original menu. Kinda bland...could not taste any fennel or red pepper flakes or anything at all for that matter in the sausage. Added jalapeno peppers for some zing but got about a tablespoon of chopped fresh peppers for $1.50 extra which I could not taste. If you want to consistently taste jalapenos use PICKLED JALAPENOS...the fresh ones vary dramatically from scorching hot to nothing...I got nothing this time. 

But I think what is really the problem is that they simply dont use enough salt in the dough or sauce. I know I know...salt is evil, but without proper seasoning you have just plain bland food, especially when using fresh vegis which dont come seasoned! I thought I would fix the problem back at the Hyatt Hotel by adding salt pepper and hot sauce but even then its too late...seasoning must be throughout you just cant put it on top. 

Still give Dragon Fire 4 stars because they are obviously trying very hard and everything is truely fresh but I dont think 5 minutes from ordering to presenting is enough time to crisp the crust and heat the ingredients through. Slices were limp and just barely hot...how bout 7 minutes...I can spare another 2 minutes for a really great crispy crust and flavorable pizza. Worth $11 with the added peppers? - ABSOLUTELY. Give them a try...hope they take some of this to heart. Bravo guys!",pos
"So, I was looking for a place that offered views of the water for my poor (land-locked) mid-western wife.  The views were exceptional!  So, let's get on to the review:

Pros:
If you want flavorful seafood and land-lubber tacos, this is the place.  The tacos are small (think tapas), so order a variety.  My wife ordered on of their ""bols"" (naked burritos) and liked it very much.  But she kept tasting my tacos!  Seriously - one of the pluses of this place is the ability to order a ""flight"" of tacos and not be over-stuffed.  I ordered four different flavors and was not at all disappointed.  I'd tell you the flavors, but I think you should create your own flight.

I did not order the, but, they have a number of reasonably priced sides to add to your entree if you desire - especially if you are splitting entrees.

Cons:
The service was not as slow as some reviews with one caveat:  They place napkins and table ware (forks) in a mason jar on the table.  Our table was out of tableware.  Our waiter and our server couldn't be bothered to bring my wife tableware - they both blamed it on the bus-staff!  Luckily, a neighboring table.  It is clear that real management is so caught up in the back -house operations that they are oblivious to the front house operations.  Ether oversight will eventually doom a restaurant, which the owners seem to not understand, or they simply don't care because liquor sales from this beautiful local offset the lack of restaurant professionalism.",pos
"Horrible doesn't begin to describe my experience on an emergency visit to Long. The vet my dog and I saw had no compassion and he was rough with my 7 1/2 year old lab, all while gruffly informing me she has lymphoma; a shocking diagnosis delivered sternly and without any mind to the devastating blow we were receiving. The doctor pulled my sweet, sick lab to him from across the room by her hind legs for examination (other doctors have always bent down to greet her sweetly). He sputtered a few things AT me, not TO me (it wasn't a conversation, he was addressing me as if I were a brick wall), then left the room abruptly. A vet tech came back in with an itemized estimate for more than $2,500 in tests the doctor didn't bother to explain. Through my tears and disbelief my instincts told me to leave immediately, pausing just long enough to pay the ER fee on my way out the door. It's worth noting that my dog was one of TWO total patients at the ER. This visit wasn't hurried or dismissive because of volume, but rather because of sheer lack of empathy and knowledge of how to do the job. 

It's taken me months to write this review because the experience was so painful. I answered a quality survey from Long just after my visit that expressed these concerns, and I asked to be contacted about my feedback. That was two months ago and they haven't had the decency to reach out to me. The vet we saw has no business in the field and Long is not the reputable institution it once was. 

I'm happy to report my lab is now seeing a WONDERUL team of providers elsewhere, and is in remission. We got the same tests at another clinic for 1/4 of the price, plus 100 times the invaluable compassion, gentleness, hope (& explanations of treatments and costs) necessary in veterinary care. The road has been bumpy but every doctor we've seen after Long (ER vets included!) has been patient, kind, and understanding. Please consider your options when caring for your four legged family members and choose elsewhere for your pet.  I will continue to tell this story to anyone I can and help spread the message!",neg
Drove all the way from Surprise... disappointed by small burned doughnuts  the red light was on which means they are supposed to hot and fresh. What a bummer!,neg
"4/5

Disclaimer: based off the Summerlicious lunch offering 

Came on a Sunday afternoon, around 12:15. Some of us were late for our initial reservation but they were accommodating and we were able to move the time back. The location is very accessible (right from Saks or off of Yonge). 

Ordered the following: 
Veal Carpaccio (App): Veal was nice and tender, and plenty of peppers and onions to match with it. Server recommended this one so thank you! 

Albacore Tuna (Main): Expected a bit more flavor, but the tuna was nice and light, complementing the salty taste of the potato.The vegetables were relatively chewy. 

Panqueques (Dessert): The glaze on the crepe was nice and sweet. Would have made for a 5 star desert if there was ice cream (or something similar) to pair with the crepes. 

The portions were quite big and I found this to be the most value out of my summerlicious ventures. Service was friendly, enthusiastic, and kept joking how we were lucky to make it to the last Summerlicious serving! I don't usually eat South American but am interested in trying more in the future after this.",pos
"Good portions, great food, kinda wish they had more specialty sushi on their menu though.",pos
"Not sure it was worth the price, but the seafood relleno was really good.  No issues with the service either.",pos
Awesome food and service.  Their shredded beef tacos were delicious.  We also had the cheese crisp and it was very good.  Loved the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa.,pos
"DO NOT USE THEM!!!! I'm taking them to court to get my deposit back. They installed the putting green with a seam after I told them no seams and it's the most unprofessional job I have ever seen for 5k. I gave them half up front and when Jeff the sales guy and the foreman came back the next day they both said they had no idea why the crew did a unprofessional job. But being a stand up company that they are Jeff said "" pay us the remaining balance and we will fix it"" yea right like I would ever see them again. I said no and that I would pay them the balance in full once it's fixed. Then he said I'll call my boss. The it was "" pay us $1600 and then we will fix it"" and now we are going to court to get my money back. I have another contractor fixing it in a few weeks and he is in shock how bad of a job LA lawns did. DO NOT USE THEM! You will regret it believe me.",neg
"First time there, food was awesome, and incridble service! Defiently a place to go and bring friends, will be back again. I hade the ceasr salad with chicken, and freshly shreded parmasan cheese with a home made dressing, the chicken was perfectly cooked and tge fresh crutons were a great touch. Their pizza and sause was amazing and their triple chocolate cake was to die for!",pos
"Hannah is a great server and the food is amazing. Be warned, you have to bring your own cheese because they don't have any.",pos
"I usually don't write good reviews because I want to help people when they dont know the places and need to make choices . Today just happened to be in the area , unexpected found this place so decided to give a try .

The seafood fried noodle sauce was too sweet , barely see any seafood except three small shrimps and squid burried underneath the veggies , also too much MSG taste in the sauce . The service was nice and attentive . The restaurant is located next to the cigar shop so there is a strong cigar smell when you walk in . Overall , if you are craving for a Vietnamese food , go to Chinatown!",pos
"Food wise, based on what I had was good. However, I'm not sure why their rating is only 3.5. I think at least they deserve at least 4 stars haha. Hope you guys will enjoy eating at this restaurant:)",pos
"STOLE MY MONEY- 
if i could give them zero stars i would. the only reason they get 1 star is so that i am able to write this review for other to see, before they get ripped off. 
We bought a truck last month. We had an agreement for payments to be taken out every other friday for a month to pay our down payment. They CONTINUE TO TAKE OUR MONEY. When confronted with the proof that we are paid in full, and that they need to stop taking money from us, they hang up on me. They are not refunding our money, and HAVE STOLEN IT. Now i will have to dispute thru the bank and potentially open a fraud case. There is no excuse for the inability to take my phone calls or to attempt to solve the problem. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY.",neg
"Overview_
It's the cheapest taco place you can find in Pittsburgh, and their tacos are actually very delicious. What can you ask for more? =) 

Directions_
Go to the store and say the number of the tacos you want. Cashier will give you a number slip, and just bring it outside to the cook. Choose the meat you want, and it will be served. You add the toppings. 

Note_
Their spicy sauces are EXTREMELY spicy, so be aware. Especially the red sauce can give you stomachache for a while.",pos
"I'm sorry this place is just terrible. 
Walked in with a completely empty place and I know why. Tacos were horrible, corn tortillas were dry as hell, tacos were tasteless. Drinks were ok however the limes were all old and turning dark brown yet they still served them. Bartender was alright but I must say the servers didn't look happy to be here.",neg
"Went here a few weeks ago and will not be coming back.  The staff was nice, but the food is less than mediocre. The kimchi fried rice was very greasy, and the shrimp tempura roll was rolled so loosely that the contents were pretty much falling out.  I don't get how this place is getting such high marks.",neg
I stopped in on friday after a bad day and sat at the bar. The bartender was super sweet and had a lot of good suggestions to offer. She was super friendly and honestly made my day better. Would definitely love to come back with a group of friends. Great atmosphere and good food :) I think my bartenders name was Sara.,pos
"Not recommended unless you get a voucher.  Lets be clear, the shuttle is supposed to run every 45 min, it doesn't.  Closer to 1h25 min! The  hotel does an exchange with Air Canada where they only pay something like $45/night so if you miss your flight with Air Canada and its their fault, don't be surprised to be staying here. However, if I'm on my own dime, I wouldn't stay here. The rooms are OK, better than I expected given the bad service and attitude from the lady that picked us up at the airport.  It is very loud though.",neg
"Brought my 06 mustang in for bumper repair on 7.24.17 and picked it up next day!! Perfect match! As if accident never happened.  Thanks to all the people involved in the repair and Janaya who kept me up to date on scheduling, costs and status of repair.  Fantastic customer service.",pos
Giving East Toyota an update. Today's service was fast! Although they were super busy. The team was moving working fast yet still very respectful on giving great services to their customers! A+!,pos
"Product aside, this establishment has zero sense of empathy, foresight, or compassion. Not providing an ATM as a cash only establishment is inconvenient, but to forcibly take half-eaten ice cream out of a child's hands when their mother promised (and offered collateral) to run to the bank to grab cash and come back is ridiculous. Bad community relations and practices, and performing a potentially traumatic and embarrassing experience to a child is unacceptable. No ice cream is worth shaming a child over a simple and easily reconcilable mistake.",neg
"Unbelievably good. An amazing atmosphere and great food!  It was a totally incredible experience dining in an incredible space.  The food is fancy, but good-sized portions and tastes amazing!",pos
The spicy miso ramen is a little bowl of heaven. This is my go-to ramen place that is light years beyond your college Maruchan days.,pos
"Amazing service! Two new air conditioners on my roof already blowing cold air. 

I needed to replace (2) old air conditioners for the home I just bought. The old a/c's were in terrible shape. They were using a lot of electricity and could not keep the house cool. I wanted to get new Seer 14 energy efficient air conditioners.

I scheduled Air Supply to replace the A/C's. The guys started unhooking my old A/C's at 9am, had the crane lift the new A'C's into place at 11am and the job was complete at 12:30pm.

Thanks for such great service! I 100% recommend Air Supply.",pos
"Best gym I've ever joined. Brittany and Maddie are always friendly and helpful.
So glad my Family joined.",pos
They had very little topping choices compared to other joints like this. Also my boyfriends pizza was so burnt he couldn't eat more than half of it.,neg
Took my Goldendoodle to Groomer Has It for bath and haircut.  Breanna did an excellent job!  She did not poodle my doodle! :-)  I showed her a picture and she did exactly what I asked.  My doodle looked and smelled great! Even his teeth were so white! I found a perfect groomer!  Very happy!,pos
"NVWM realty is is AMAZING. Everyone that I had the pleasure to work with truly accommodated my every need!!! Their service and dedication to their customers are second to none and really exceeded my expectations. Unlike many other firms in Vegas, they are very prompt and quick to respond to any inquiries I may have had. They remained professional at all times which is something I look for when searching for homes. I recommend this firm to everyone, trust me you will not regret it!!!!",pos
this place is the BEST! Daniel does an amazing job with my nails and I don't think I can every see anyone else. They get really busy so make sure to make an appointment.,pos
"Billy Bishop Airport is the poor cousin of Pearson Airport, it being a small regional alternative to its bigger peer. It almost has the feel of a bus depot than an airport. But it's convenient enough, with shuttle bus taking you to downtown. Not that it's as convenient as the train shuttle at Pearson, but hey, it's free, and you can't beat that. Generally, when I have time on hand, I tend to choose Billy Bishop over Pearson.",neu
Olive & IVY is my favorite place to eat and hang out in all of Scottsdale. I live in Nebraska but my daughter lives in Scottsdale and every time I visit her we go to Olive and Ivy. The atmosphere is terrific and I love sitting out on the patio in the cooler months.The food is always great!,pos
Absolute crap. The beds are horrible. Both my partner and I are in excruciating pain from the horrible mattress. We complaoned about the qualoty of the pillows and mattress and looked at us and said...well we can't do much. They shouls switch the name to Town inn Dumps,neg
"The atmosphere is good. But this place is a lot different than other Phoenix restaurants. You must order in the front first. Then you go up to the front and grab your food. The price isn't cheap,so don't expect to get filled for bring less than $10. Overall it's a good place. But the reason why I gave it 3 stars because of the price. It's more expensive than other Phoenix restaurants.",neu
"Went to Top Golf this weekend with some friends wanting to check out a new fun place. We were not disappointed at all! No, the parking is not super convenient, however, some walking when on the strip should be expected, and it IS Vegas... it's hot here. When we got there around 930 on a Saturday night we were informed there would be an hour wait for a bay so we put our name in and went to one of the many bars inside the facility. Great service and good drinks. Our bay was ready earlier than 1 hour and once in the bay we had an awesome time! The guy who showed us to our bay was very friendly and knowledgeable and our server was on top of our drink situation the whole 3 hours we were there. We ordered the BBQ platter and the food was delicious and plenty for all 6 of us to share. Let's not forget the main attraction, the golf! So fun competing in the games against everyone and great club options to use. Bonus points locals get 20% off, so for a locals night out definitely 5 stars!",pos
"First time here and it was overall delicious! Place was nice and clean. Several choices of meat and veggies to chose from. They also had 4 types of sauces and 2 types of crust. Staff was nice and helpful. Flavors were good and the fact on Tuesday you can have any and all toppings for $6, is the way to go!

Knocking off two stars because my friends pizza had hair. It seemed as if it was in the dough and not a random flyaway. Nonetheless, that was disgusting!

Hopefully the next time we go there won't be anymore hair in the dough.",pos
Thanks staff was super friendly and welcoming but I won't be returning. We are new to the state so I brought my dog to get established and a prescription for his anxiety (something he has had for a long time) I was told about $45 for the visit. They brought me a bill for over $440 expecting me to pay for it without even offering and explaining everything. I declined everything but it really made me feel like they only care about the money. The Dr was even talking to me about other things that weren't even an issue as if trying to find more to charge me for. I am very disappointed in our visit and will be finding someone who actually cares about my pet and not only the money.,pos
Yes yes yes !!!!! Fish is fantastic - moist on the inside and a beautiful fry to finish !!!! Shrimp is just as good - big and juicy too!!! Didn't get a chance to try the fries but as they tossed the garlic fries my mouth was watering.,pos
This place reminded me of a pub back where I live in Northwest Indiana aka or the region. Any way the food is great and staff was wonderful. Especially loved live entertainment and outdoor games. Great job continue with the great work. I'll be coming back there when I have a chance. Thank you staff and management for making me feel at home with your establishment.,pos
This is the worst customer service ever. I tired to cancel my flight within 24 hours amd they refused to process as they said it passed 24 hours. It is not ture. Their system has flaws and made mistake. I tried to explain to 2 different agents that i have the email to prove that it was still within 24 cancellation period but they refused to listen and refuse to help and kept accusing me how wrong I was.....Then I called Alsaka airline directly and cancelled the ticket without any additional cancellation fee becuase I cancelled within 24 hours!!!. I have never experienced any customer service worst than this. Not only refusing to listen but accusing customer to be wrong. I will never purchase anything from this company and make sure all my friends know what happened.,neg

"This is THEE best Thai place in Phoenix.... or maybe in my life! And no, I haven't been to Thailand so that means the best I have in the United States! 

NO JOKE! I go here so often, I know the staff. I got so often, I have brought at least 12-15 new people with me and recommended it to at least 6 clients who have gone by themselves. I go so often that I sometimes run into other people I have gotten hooked on the place! I have gone on my birthday! I have brought out of town visitors there! I being clients, friends, family and co-workers!!!

I honestly shouldn't have to tell you how good to food is after the above. But here goes: IT'S FABULOUS! Fresh, made to order, even their rice! So good, delicious, and SUPER VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! 

Honestly, worth trying- you won't be sorry. Poi and her wonderful staff will do a great job taking care of you!!!!!",pos

"I'm a 1750 hour CFI. This place sells groupons for simulator rides, so if that's your game, enjoy the video game. But, if you're a real pilot I'd recommend another FBO. To give you an idea, when I asked my flight instructor, Sean, about his flight experience, he actually used his dad's military service on his resume'! So sad... Hell, my dad was a surgeon, doesn't make me one. That was the best part of my experience at this place. I've been been stood up for flights and had planes cancelled hours before a family trip and just an overall feeling they don't give a sh#t.

Run!!!!!!!",neg
"I did NOT stay in this hotel. However, walking around it was enough to know it deserves one star or less. It has a terrible smell, very dirty, and very dark. The smoke smell seemed stronger here than anywhere else. Maybe this is because it's so old and doesn't have as good of a ventilation system as some of the other hotels? We came to see the middway/shows but we couldn't stay long as the smell was making my mother sick. I actually think the Circus Circus in Reno is nicer.",neg
"Visions by David is awesome! This family business has an extensive portfolio of timeless images. Not only do they have an award winning reputation, but they also have such fun personalities which would make the photo shoot experience that much more enjoyable. As a bride raving how happy I am with how my pictures turned out, I'm confident the memories they capture for others will keep them smiling for a lifetime.",pos
"A legit boba shop in Henderson. Finally!! I was able to sample several different flavors during their BOGO. My favorite ones were the coconut thai tea, black coffee with sea salt, and wintermelon milk tea! 

The drinks are made well, but my taro slush and okinawa milk tea were a bit off from what I am used to.

Toppings: good. Boba up to par with the more popular spots. Grass jelly, melt in your mouth goodness. 

They have fruity teas and slushies that are so refreshing! I love the chamango drink, but wished there were more blended mango in there!

They have an electronic system to earn a reward. Pretty typical, if you buy 10, get one free. 

I like the decor of the place, it's definitely done well; however, it's not really a stay and hang out kind of place.",pos
After some extremely unpleasant experiences with various AC companies I have finally found the one I want to do business with. Chris is a specialist in his craft and is very friendly and genuine person. I highly recommend Bond Heating and Air Conditioning!!!,pos
"Food was decent, but getting any kind of service was a chore. After standing awkwardly at the entrance for an uncomfortable amount of time we were told to sit anywhere. Chose a high top and waited while servers walked by, passing us off to each other. Finally got one who took our drink order, then disappeared. When she brought our drinks, she asked if we wanted menus. We ordered, but the beer and appetizers were served at the same time as the meal. We still didn't have napkins or silverware, and the runner said we'd have to ask someone else for that because he didn't know where it was. The order was wrong and never corrected. Still waiting to see our server and get the check so we can head out and never come back. There's someone arguing with another server that he wants his ID returned, so at least that's entertaining.

There's so much focus on the daily events that service feels like an afterthought. Big mistake.

Update: Got the bill and we were overcharged. Surprise.",neg
"Hostess never smile and made us feel unwelcome, food was ok, beer was nice and cold, service was friendly but needs some work. Busser was very friendly and doing most of the work. Place looks clean I hope next time I give five stars.",neu

"Today marks 1 year that I've been coming in to this place and I'm so glad I came in. I found a new place to come to every few weeks after my last nail of 7 years retired from doing nails.  I'm so glad I have a new place to come to. The new owners took over this place at the beginning of July 2016. 
They always have good selection of  glitter gel colors which I always go with in a fade or ombre style. I especially Love that i can go almost 3 weeks before coming in again. I don't always get a pedicure, but when I do, my time there is a relaxing time for nails and a pedicure day. 
Andrew and Jennifer are both knowledgeable and very easy to communicate with. I always look forward to my Nail day. 
Thank you for always making my nails look beautiful, fresh, and new everytime.",pos
It's a scary place where males that are shirtless and only ordering water and glaring at female patrons while sitting on patio and spending inordinate times in bathroom,neg
The food was delicious and came out pretty fast. I had the chicken and waffles with apple compote and almost fell asleep after eating it. It was so worth it though! The service wasn't the best but the place is always packed. I highly recommend it!,pos
"I arrived around 7:50 I wanted the gel polish soaked off because they've turned brown before my birthday trip to Miami. My whole purpose of getting gel was to maintain the crisp white clean look, she then said well makeup can change the nails she didn't say that before. I sat down by this time and 30/40 minutes passed by whole time asking her to get the foil to soak off the gel she ignored me when I sat in the chair for my pedicure the lady was concentrating on everything but my feet the polish is awful I didn't see it until I got home I then was approached I the owner/cashier saying that I needed to come back tmrw she needed to get home to her babies and I was instantly furious because she could have told me that earlier and I could have went elsewhere I said I wasn't going anywhere and I wont paying for anything until I got a full service some man then began to ask me if I wanted him to call security I simply told him that idgaf who you call by this time they had 5/7 nail techs cleaning ready to go they didn't care if I was satisfied only ready to leave there customer service is horrible and I will be going for them to fix my toe for F R E E ! but they will not be getting anymore of my money !

What a great breakfast/ lunch place that even offers catering! The owners here will walk up and greet you personally. The menu for both breakfast and lunch is extensive. You'll want to go back again and again to try the different offerings. In addition they deliver to local businesses and the restaurant  offers free WiFi! Nice place to eat and keep up with work. The ambience is done as an old 50's diner with all the Coca-Cola memorabilia. And the service staff is friendly and helpful. This is a must try!,pos
Wonderful service! So responsive! Reasonably priced! Great final product! Quick turnaround! Would definitely use again! Highly recommend!,pos

"We have been sitting here for about 45 minutes, and they're not anywhere close to our number. This is considered fast food to me, so I don't know why it takes THIS LONG. It is absolutely ridiculous!! The food isn't good enough to wait this long. It's hot inside the restaurant, they play (what sounds like) the same song over and over again and we're thinking of just leaving because who has a free hour and a half to wait around for tacos??",neg
"This little mom and pop establishment can be easily missed as it sits in the shadow of a condo complex on a fairly quiet corner of the 7th Ave and Thomas St intersection.  I have heard about this place from several people. The name of the establishment is rather memorable in a funny way...  ""Long Wong""....  *giggles*  So, of course, I've always wanted to try the wings out.   

I ordered the 12 wing plate and fries.  The fries were not very good to me or my friend.  In fact, my friend didn't eat the fries... I was a little hungry so I had more than a few of them.  They weren't very good.  Plenty of the reviews reported how quickly the wings come out... This I can say is quite true.  I am not sure I was in my seat more than 5 minutes before they were calling me.  The wings themselves were severely overcooked with little to no flavor.  I prefer my wings to be sauce-less so I can dip them.  This means your chicken wing has to have some seasoning and taste good plain.  Unfortunately, these wings don't taste like they have any seasoning on them before they are cooked.  If the wings themselves don't taste good stand alone (without sauce), it is difficult for me to enjoy the wings.  However, the sauce on the flavorless wings was good.  .


People swear these are the best hot wings in Phoenix.  I beg to differ.

"I started searching for the best deal I could find on a Santa Fe with dealerships in Las Vegas, Utah and Los Angeles and found that deal here.  Due to my work, which kept me in LA for several weeks, I had to arrange the deal by phone and email and fly in on a Saturday to do the deal.  I had some trepidation about buying a car this way but Tony and Allan did exactly what they said they would do, the deal was exactly as they had quoted and it was the best deal I found out of several Hyundai dealerships in three states.  Allan even picked us up at the airport!  I've never had a better experience buying a car.",pos

"Since one of the earlier bartender, Amy, was so consistently good it's tough to have a poor girl that seems unhappy to be there.  This newer bartender is competent and will get your drink but no conversation or even 'how's it going tonight?'  And I'm talking about during an empty bar and just few people at the tables, 3 couples.  It's been this way for the last year. I've mentioned her lack of personality to others that were working and they nod and say 'sorry'.  The happy hour used to be packed- no room at the bar with regulars and new comers, but now very few people are ever there.  I'm a big fan of the laid-back personality but not in this type of bar setting.  I like this spot better than Ladera but over and over we are disappointed with the lack of personality with the entire place.  There is a very sweet table server  that chats with everyone and brings a bit of life to the experience. Please, please - new bartender!?!  I hate to see this spot close but they must be losing business.",neu
Cold Stone's is like my other favorite ice cream place to go to pretty much always the same thing like I said I don't like change its the strawberry blonde which is really good birthday cake remix even when it's not my birthday and there was one that I made up a long time ago but now they don't have it I called it a Dublin mudslide. But they don't have all the ingredients to make it so they're missing the coffee ice cream it's like a chocolate coffee ice cream that I loved and add Brownie and caramel and hot fudge  sauce,neu
"I've always been phobic of dentists but Dr. Naik and her staff have helped me overcome my phobia.  First of all, her office is decorated in such an elegant manner, which creates a welcoming atmosphere.  Her staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Dr. Naik has such a gentle touch and really provides care in a manner to ease my phobic nature.  I guess that explains why she's been profiled as a Top Dentist for many years.

"Wow so bad. More to follow. Yelp will not allow me to post this as a tip
This place has been completely awful. I am referring to the orthopedic unit at this hospital. 
I want to start off by rehashing the past.  I needed to have or supposedly need to have ulnar nerve transposition.  I had the surgery and nerve surgery is one of the most painful procedures one can have.  I was not warned of this or treated for this. I was told I would be good in 2 weeks. Wrong . I learned about this after the fact.  I did not do my research was my fault.  Coming out of surgery my elbow was on fire.  I was persribed Celebrex . That was not enough or even correct for the type of surgery I had.  Crazy pain. So when i paged my so called surgeon's  line the nurse told me to double my Celebrex doses. Well I did this and when  ran out 2 weeks later they would not give me more.  Right, non narcotic request for pain control and was denied. I had to ask my PCP for a non narcotic pain medication because my surgeon was pretty much incompetent .  Dr. Shaffer was the dude, avoid if possible

Fast forward now 7/25/17, I have double torn meniscus and I am back at UH because of my PCP is UH. I go to the same orthopedic office and  keep an open mind. But the same shit starts happening. I am not getting the full story. I did not receive a copy of my MRI result till afterward i was told i needed surgery.  The Dr that was reading my MRI results had a copy that referred to BOTH my right knees.(Yes Both)

I then called the office and asked to have surgery and they could only book 3 weeks out(which to my understanding is not bad). I then called and asked if i could get crutches and the admim person advises i would be better off with a walker (I can still walk and function, just not a lot of pressure on one knee). I finally got the script for crutches (I think). I also asked for scrip for  a handicapped spot so i do not have to deal with stairs as my job only has a parking garage with stairs. They seemed to ignore this.",pos
"I would not recommend this office for children. One of the front desk employees was very friendly and helpful, the other was rude. The MA that did the initial evaluation with my son had no patience what so ever. My son is 6 and obviously children require more explanation and guidance. She was getting extremely frustrated that he couldn't keep his eyes wide open without moving them. She expected him to be able to do it quickly and unfortunately it made her extremely frustrated that he needed multiple chances to do it properly. She was rude and not explaining anything to him in a way that a child could understand. The Dr was slightly better, but also lacked the patience needed to deal with children. Due to his lack of patience I am also questioning his evaluation and will now need to get a second opinion. After we finished the exam and were looking at frames, another employee came up to us, basically rushing me to choose. I opted to get the RX and will order glasses elsewhere. Overall it was a very poor experience, lacked professionalism and they really shouldn't be booking pediatric exams if they can't have a little extra patience with a young child. I will not be returning.",neg

Also took advantage of their egg roll deal on yelp and it's ok, but I'm not big on egg rolls. Ordered the beef chow mein and shrimp fried rice, which both are really big portions and delicious, so definitely worth the price!",pos
"Cute little place.  Went twice, once on a weekend and once on a weekday. On a weekend you might have to wait a little while for a table it was pretty packed. But on a weekday there should be no wait. I'd say it's pretty reasonably priced. The service was kind of slow when we went on a weekend but that's expected. The waitress kept us loop as to why it was taking long and offered us some free food, can't remember what she offered but she was very nice. The second time it was kind of slow and there weren't a ton of people there. The waitress was a mess. She forgot my drink. Didn't ever come back to get us more water or drink refills. And she switched our orders with another table. There was only 2 of us. Shouldn't have been as complicated as she made it. Not a pleasant second experience. I liked the country fried steak. Ordered it both times.",pos
Had a great experience here. Our server Nancy was excellent and gave our party great recommendations. We had wonderful glasses of cabernet to complement our awesome Italian food.

My favorite part of the meal was the bread that came with an amazing green chutney sauce.",neu
"Tasty food, several good vegetarian options, and thoughtful service. We stumbled on this place while on our way to a different restaurant and decided to give it a try by just ordering snacks. The restaurant is clean and comfortable inside, although the music was just a touch loud (all hard surfaces in there). I enjoyed a mojito with plenty of fresh lime and mint, and also ordered the garlic-marinara seats, which is a dish of mushrooms with peppers and tomato. The vegetables were bright and flavorful and the bread (drizzled with olive oil and grilled) was delicious. My husband got the casserole Zandru's which he really enjoyed.",pos

"4 years ago we purchased a home In Maricopa with serous pigeon issues. They responded to my request and within a few weeks they took care of the problem, they put up spikes, wired all nesting areas and wired  all the edges of our one story home. All the best and droppings were cleaned up! Never had another issue until we put up solar panels with Solar City, because it's a guarantee with any roof issues with Solar City I called them, they sent The Pigeon Guy to remove the nest, I was really happy to know they were coming to take care of! The best we're removed from under the panels and wires put up around them to prevent more nesting. And again all the droppings were cleaned up. Having such great results and service I recommended them to my daughter In Queen Creek , they were scheduled to come to her home 7/5 but never showed up or returned any of her calls. I felt bad that they didn't show up so I called and also left them a message asking them to please contact her, but they never did. I would love to give them a 5 star rating because they do good work. My daughter also had suggested them to their friends who just built a large home and was looking for someone to take care of their pigeon issues, but has since let them know they never showed up or returned calls.",pos

The last time we went, it was a nightmare, they took about 20 minutes to take our order, we patiently waited until we noticed they started serving the table next to us with four people that arrived about 20 minutes after we did, I called the waiter who looked at me with a annoyed face while he walked away, he didn't come to our table so I had to yell to ask about our food. A couple of minutes later someone else comes out of the kitchen with our waitress to explain that they lost the order while he was holding it on his hand saying ""do you want to wait or....? So we left those delicious tacos and salsas behind because we were too hangry to wait one more minute and they didn't offer us free chips to eat more salsas...  the food is really good the service is really shitty..",neu

"Dining at Carson's was unique for two reasons: one, dishes were featured in small platters so that we could get a taste of each without it ever growing old on us; two, our family got to share dishes, rather than eating a plate each, making it a delightful ""family night"" experience. Although a bit on the pricey side, it was well worth the 30 minute walk.",pos

According to the coupon alcohol was not counted toward the discount, so it should not have mattered.

What a bait and switch if ever I heard this!  We will not be back and I will also let social media  know how you handle these situations as well.  So unfair and what is the point of the coupon. Better add this information to your useless coupon prior to us ordering drinks and also during dinner time. You don't keep long time customers by treating them this way.  No Class!",neg

Their picadillo salad that comes with many dishes is very refreshing and flavorful. Both times I've been there, the guy behind the counter taking the orders was super friendly and helpful in explaining what the dishes were. Really good customer service!",pos
"Oh my gosh, I love Crazy Pita and I frequent all three of the locations in town. This is truly a local business, with a trio of locations owned by one guy. All three have their strengths and weaknesses, but all three serve absolutely delicious food. 

If you're looking for healthy eats, this is your place. Sure, you can get a plate of french fries if you must, but the grilled skewers, Mediterranean vegetables, hummus with olive oil, Greek salad, and fluffy couscous are good for your body! My go-to here is the mixed skewer plate ($15) with chicken and shrimp. The plate comes with a hearty skewer of grilled chicken breast, a skewer of grilled shrimp, couscous with tasty veggies (including squash and zucchini), an amazing feta salad (topped with olives, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta), and a little side of hummus with pita bread (white or whole wheat). 

The portions may be hearty but the prices certainly are hefty. I like to eat here before or after a movie and dinner for two with sodas runs a little over $40.00 with tax. That's almost as much as eating at a sit-down full service restaurant!

But as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and the food is seriously top notch. Quality ingredients make for a happy tummy. I've also noticed that the employees at all the locations are a cut above most fast food workers. Think In-N-Out quality employees.  

There are a couple of minor negatives, however. First, let's talk about the hummus. I know Crazy Pita probably has wants to have dumbed-down hummus that appeals to non adventurous eaters, but their version is pretty lame. It's also so watery and thin that it doesn't even taste like or resemble traditional hummus (I want thick hummus topped with olive oil)! They do provide a communal olive oil container by the soda machine, but it's low quality oil, or at least it tastes like it. Second, I really, really hate how when you place an order at the register and pay via credit card, the system automatically prompts you to add a tip. A tip? For what?! I despise how so many places are guilt tripping customers into tacking on 20% or more to reward a person for simply doing their job. I have to tip someone taking an order? No thanks.

Overall Crazy Pita is the tops. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Yes, it's expensive and can get pricey really quickly (if you order soda or sides). But give it a try, I know you'll love it!",pos
"It's alright, cozy atmosphere, and is one of a very few tea/coffee places in the area that's open past 10pm (with barely any crazy people inside).

I consider my mom a coffee enthusiast. She said the aroma of the coffee was one of the best she has ever smelled. It was also freshly brewed so no cream and sugar was needed. My mom and I shared the chicken and mushroom crepe and it was more than enough. We actually stayed full the whole entire day! My boyfriend and my sister ordered the same sandwich and they both pretty much kicked their plates clean. 

Can't give it a full 5 stars due to the service lacking. It was hard to get a hold of our waiter and he didn't really check up on our table. 

I would definitely come back!",pos
"Went here due to their great reviews. Would never recommend this facility to anyone of my pet owning friends. When scheduling I was told my dog would cost $127.50 for her spay and that was with the new customer discount and assuming my dog weighed under 25Ibs. Upon arriving my dog weighed more than expected so I was prepared to pay the 20 or 30 dollar price difference, they also stated that the vaccine record I brought in said she was due for a vaccine update and asked if I would like to update her, I agreed assuming it was a normal one shot booster. When I came after work to pick my pup up and pay the bill it was $279!?! I payed the balance and then requested the invoice with the breakdown of her visit, they gave her every vaccine they could, the front desk gave us a wrong price on the phone (they quoted us for a nueter, not a spay), they also didn't include the 15% discount for being a new customer. When I started to get upset due to the complete lack of organization and communication Christina the front office employee became snarky and rude. She asked me why I even let her take the payment... 100% unprofessional. I am even more appalled at the manager Jim, who I was told to contact the next day to discuss a partial refund for services I wasn't aware they were rendering, a refund of $18.50 for the collar, and apply the 15% discount to my bill. While discussing my concerns on repeated vaccines (specifically her rabies vaccine which is the 3 year, and its recommended they have another at 1 year, not required so why was it given) and employee communication I received a completely disinterested response from him, at one point he asked me why I was ""blaming"" the front staff and the doctor (who was supposed to counsel us on her medication, but forgot due to the present complaints from myself) for the mistakes and said that he was being blunt and honest by telling me I should take some accountability for not understanding my pets vaccine record and not requesting an elaboration on what her updates on vaccines entailed before agreeing. He then stated that he felt we were just talking in circles and that he needs to know what I want. I told him the 18 for the collar because I did not take it home, the 3 vaccines that are recommended to update, again not required, and the 15% discount to be applied to the total bill, he said ok and to come in at my earliest convenience for the refund. I told him I work until 5 and would be by then. When arriving at the vet the manager was not there, which seemed very disrespectful due to the level of pissed off these guys made me already, again the other staff was great, but Christina was just as rude as the first encounter. She walks by as the other front desk woman was handing me my receipt and sets a vaccine information sheet for the rabies-3 next to her hand and says that's for her, didn't look at me one time. Then laughs and walks off, I thank Christina and let her know that I won't be needing it and I'm fully aware of the vaccine and its indications (I happen to manage a doctor's office that is state registered to administer vaccines) she smirks and walks off around the corner. I can't tell you how unprofessional and disheartening this whole ordeal was. I will never recommend this facility to any pet owner. They are disorganized, very rude, and the professionalism is absent all the way up to the manager.",neg

I was an assistant manager working for them for almost 7 months. I was salaried, so I expected to work more hours than anyone, it's inherent in a salary...however, what I did not expect was to work between 115-130 hours per pay period every single pay period therefore making my calculated hourly wage at around $8.90-$9.60...less than the current minimum wage. The ONLY reason I worked that hard for that long with that low of a calculated wage, was that I was promised a promotion from day one, it's even in the offer letter I have. I continuously asked for support, which I never received, and feedback, to which I was told ""you're doing great, be more assertive with the employees"" and that's it. Basically, I had a bad month, lost a close family member, and had my car impounded, as a result I called off sick twice. Instead of them giving me a warning or telling me that this wasn't working for them...or maybe offering a helping hand in a time of need...they decided to terminate me without thought.
 Now, the problems with the handling of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant are terrible. I have pictures, which I will post, of every time I came in to open the store how AWFUL a condition it was left in each night. There was standing water left under the sinks and counters, mixed in with food and other things, the pads which the gluten free and high rise dough are put directly on to cook weren't cleaned off at all each night, just put back into a pan dirty (which the only cleaning that took place with these mats anyways was to wipe them down with a paper towel), the drain for the beer tap was not cleaned each night, causing little fruit flys and larvae to gather all around the drain each night. The trash cans were never cleaned out, building up with terrible odors underneath the bags. The mops were never wrung out and hung upside down in the mop sink as they were SUPPOSED to be, causing more flies in the back area.
  Another MAJOR issue is that the female night managers didn't take any temps as required by the company and the health Dept, and leave the daily temp logs blank...when bringing this to the attention of my Manager, she would just have those managers go back and pencil whip the temps and signatures from time to time. I continuously brought these issues to the attention of my Managers, Summer, Joe, and Kyra, telling them that I needed support, and that I was tired and burned out, and needed some support and needed a management  team that was on the same page and working together, however, they did nothing about it. They brushed it off because they didn't like me for some reason. Again, trying so hard to fix these issues, trying so hard to work towards a better, cleaner store, and I was the one to get let go because I had a bad month. If you value a clean establishment that treats their employees well and follows health codes, policies, and procedures... don't go here.",neu
Came here for breakfast. Great food especially for the cheap price and great ice chai. A bit confusing that you have to order from the counter then get service to your table. We sat at the open bar outside. There is plenty of shade when it is sunny out. Decor indoors is also nice. It reminds me slightly of the types of restraunts/bars in downtown in Europe. Still need to come back for dinner.,neu
"I love East Side Mario's but this location was the worst...restaurant I have ever been to!! The host was a bit eccentric but that wasn't the issue until I told him that we were ready to order, after being seated for 15 minutes with no one to check on us. He freaked out a little and said he doesn't take any orders and that our server would be with us very shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed, I stopped another server and asked for our server because we were ready to order. Few mins later she came by with bread told us our server was still busy (for the past 30+ minutes) and ONLY took our drink orders. My friend and I chatted some more finished, we finished bread and another 10+ minutes passed...we still haven't gotten our drinks or our server.  At this point we've waited for over 40 minutes and we decided to leave. The shittiest part was we watched 2 tables that came after us got serviced before we did. 

Don't recommend this location, will never go back! And I work in food and beverage lol!",neg

"This was my second visit, and i ordered a medium boneless with two different sauces for takeout. They didn't even go over my order and with 30 minutes waiting time, I just assumed everything will be correct and came home. I opened the two boxes and they were the same flavor.. They had everything on the receipt correct... I guess it was the kitchens fault.",pos
"Choosing the right window treatments is critical, both for function (privacy, room darkening effects) and for contributing largely to the overall style of a home. It's also a design element that typically lasts the duration of the time you live there, so it's important to get it right. The House of Window Coverings was the right company to guide us in this process. Their employees were thoroughly professional, punctual and courteous. In particular, Karen, who made a visit to our home prior to our install, seemed more like our personal interior designer than a person offering a consultation. She has such tremendous experience in helping clients select their window coverings, but beyond that, she is genuinely passionate about her work. Her knowledge of design, scale, balance and colors was phenomenal. Her sincerity and concern for my family was obvious. She let my husband and I ask a million decorating questions and offered us wonderful suggestions and ideas to pull together all the elements of our house. We found her simply invaluable.  Her years in the business informed her that in order to offer us the right window coverings, she needed to know our preferences and general personalities so she could help us express it in our home.  She specifically knew exactly what kind of window coverings would offer us privacy on our sliders without compromising our city view, - a view which was a big reason we bought the house originally. In our case, Hunter Douglas Luminettes were the perfect answer. They were an answer we hadn't found on our own search and they were truly an ingenious curtain option.  We are so glad we met Karen and found our unique and contemporary solution. It's overwhelming to decorate a whole house, but, thanks to The House of Window Coverings, we had one less problem to conquer.  And, thanks to the sweet way Karen had with assisting us, we knew she truly cared about our results as much as we did.",neu
"On my usial business trip-induced quest for fiber before my flight back to The Big Crapple, my wife suggested I try Living Kitchen (she now insists she didn't, but that's a reflection on our marriage, not the restaurant).  

The restaurant is in what looks like a recently Milenn-trified part of town, you know, where they renovate an old factory or warehouse into what is effectively a post-modern mall where the self-conscious bourgeois hyperenlightened masses can bask in luxury while evading micro-aggressions in a wholesome, nonjudgemental safe space.

I ordered the Fire and Brimstone burger and a beet salad.  Both were pretty good, although way short on the fire for a region so famous for its BBQ.

I am sure many other people have commented on the languid service.

I'm not in the free management consulting industry, but I'll offer my keen insight.  The main reason why the service is as laconic as it is, is because customer service is not part of the conception of the business.  

The food, decor and even the customer demographic is finely honed, but as a workplace, the vibe is more a relaxed work environment geared to pleasant working conditions than a passionate dedication to excellence.  

Surveying the staff, I could not identify anyone that ancient people used to call a manager.

In any case, if you like ""raw"", nutritious bohemian fare and your time is not that valuable to you, you could do somewhat worse than this ultra-contemporary. Yupstaurant.",pos
"Came here for lunch and couldn't be happier (or fuller). Pork adobo, Thelma's special (lechon pork with tomatoes, onions, and a soy sauce-based sauce), and pork gisante with rice, macaroni salad. and garlic rice.

Get your intro to Filipino food here, and you won't be sorry.",pos
Had a good experience with the server who first greeted us but soon after we got harassed by a second server as well as the owner of the restaurant when trying to order a drink. After showing three forms of identification (because we are from out of state) The server litteraly yelled at us to the point where we got up and walked out without ordering a thing. I've never experienced such terrible customer service before in my life. They are rude and do not treat their customers with any respect. I would expect a lot more from a place like this. I wish I could give them less than one star.,pos

"(Through Ubereats) Ordered the carne asada tacos w/ rice and beans and horchata... everything was heavily ""seasoned"" with salt! The rice was also heavily undercooked. The horchata wasn't too bad, but it was essentially an iced chai latte. Not sure if I'd give this place another shot.",pos

Amazing place! I had been to many different tattoo shops looking for a tattoo I wanted and didn't love the people or places enough. I had given up when I saw this place and went inside to see.

It was very clean and all the people were very nice. I'm defidently coming here for all my other tattoos!,pos
"We were given a recommendation from our neighbor to come here. The cashier at the front was really helpful when I told her we had never been there before. She was able to explain some things and give us her recommendations. We thought that the beef was better than the chicken, the salsa was spicy and yummy, and the chocolate chimis were delicious. It's a semi-sweet chocolate, probably just chocolate chips, but chocolate deep fried in a tortilla is always delicious!",pos

"Love, love this store. I stop in everytime I go to the mall and get something. They let you try out so many of their products and you always leave smelling really good.

Pricing seems very high but bombs and other bath bars, oils and bubbleroons can be broken up for several uses which makes pricing very reasonable.

The kids get their ""rainbow"" moldable soap. Great as a bath color changer, soap or shampoo. I usually cut each color into 4ths. I also get them the ""ickle baby bot"" which has lavender and chamomile great for before bedtime.

I personally like the melts or luxury bath oils. They leave your skin so soft. Plus the melts arent fizzy like the bombs.

They have a ton of other products from make up, facial cleaners, shampoo, conditioners and products for men. 

Lots of staff at this location and they are super helpful and friendly.",pos

The Peppermill is a 24/7 must for the Vegas visitor looking for the taste and feel of Old Vegas. Bright, lively and always open The Peppermill will not disappoint if you're looking for a great drink (or 5) and some solid diner food.

The sampler platter was okay.

Our Blue Hawaiians were super tasty!

Our server, Kaitlyn, was attentive, helpful, and on top of all our needs even though she was skillfully dealing with a large table of 16 people while taking care of us at the same time. We tipped her well but should have tipped even more! Thank you Kaitlyn!

Probably my favorite taco place in Las Vegas but those lines be extra long. If you're in a rush pass it up but if you have time defiantly try some good fresh tacos. The lines are a bit confusing too.

"The Industrial was the perfect venue for my birthday party! It was one of the best nights of my life. First off, the venue was 5 minutes from the strip so all of my friends that came from out of town stayed on the strip and had a quick cab ride over. They let me transform the entire space with pipe and drape, a flower wall, and an awesome sound system.The rigging points made it easy for the Cirque performer to spin, the champagne girl to be suspended and pouring bubbly for the guests. I was able to bring in my own vendors: catering ( Wolfgang Puck ) florals (Miss Daisy) and event management company (Best Agency). Everyone was fantastic and easy to work with. The parking lot was large and safe enough for all 150 guests to park their cars with valet or self park. I would recommend this venue for anyone looking for a large blank space to create any type of event, with decor it adds richness to the space, without it you have this awesome urban warehouse vibe that is hard to find in Las Vegas. I can't wait for my next event at The Industrial!",pos

"So i was released from hospital with a life vest ( defibrillator) diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  I called to make an appointment with TRi city instead of going with hospital referred doctors.  Big huge mistake.  When i get there i check in which was hard cause by the time i walked down the hall through garage i was light headed.  Receptionist knew this,  yet nobody paid any real concern.  They call me to go in back to see doctor.  The girl that took me back looked and acted like she hated her job ( BIG TIME).  I walk in small little room start asking me questions.  I asked if they got medical records from hospital.  She says no!!  i couldnt believe it.  I signed a release for them to get the records..  Finally they find them which tells me doctor didnt pay any attention to a guy coming to see him wearing a life vest.  Doctor didnt have a clue of what was going on with me.  Actually he asked me how im recovering from GALLBLADDER being removed.  WTF is he talking about...  Then tells me I dont need my life vest and to take it off...  WTF!!! Then wanted to take me off heart medication to help my heart saying i Dont need it.  So im on lasik medication yet he wouldnt prescribe Potassium pills to help with crapping.  Somthing you should really be on when on Lasik .  I could go on and on about how stupid this guy is or Should I say Clueless.  He didnt give a shit....  he just wanted to get me out of there.  Then he Tells me to go to check out.  Okay,  i put my vest back on as he said i guarantee i wont need it..  Talk about arrogant!  
         So now i'm at check out.  Some guy with shoulder length hair walks into the girls area.  He says who keeps scheduling DR. STERN he will refuse any more patience.  Stop scheduling him he will refuse all new patience.  This guy  just went on and on right in front of me.  Im thinking that is messed up to say infront of  one of his new Patience..  Well at least that explains why he could of gave a shit less about me. He was just pushing me out cause he didnt even want me as a patient.  Which was obvious after things the Doctor said..  
1. Nobody knew i was on life vest!!!! pretty hard not to see.
2. My Gallbladder taken out.  Hey buddy get better glasses... far from it...
3. Taking me off Heart medication C.H.F...  very stupid..
4. Telling me to take my life vest off and saying I dont need it.  IDIOT i almost died..
5. DR. STERN dont want more patience..  Thanks for making me feel like shit...

They don't pay attention to orders, have zero customer service skills, and management clearly doesn't care, as they only have 17 reviews and 98% of them are bad.

"I found Auprés de Ma Blonde while looking for a place to hang out and have a drink while waiting for a reservation at a ""big F'ing deal"" place nearby. My coworker and I just wanted to have a drink but the smell of the food (mussels) coming out prompted me to ask my coworker if we should eat here instead. He replied that I'd made such a big F'ing deal about the ""big F'ing deal"" place that we had to go there. The other place disappointed us both and Auprés de Ma Blonde didn't when I stopped in on my next trip to Montreal. The mussels and fries are awesome. The steaks have been really good too. One of the low reviews criticizes the fish n chips. Seriously, you ordered the fish n F'ing chips at a bistro in Montreal?!  I bet he orders the burger when he goes to Katz's. If the place is busy then the wait service suffers a bit but no big deal. Order a Belle Geuele or a Cheval Blanc and some mussels and enjoy!",pos

He also let me try the sauces before committing to them. Poke itself is okay, I think it's a little too much sushi for me, but the fact that the person helping me was so patient and explained the process to me is the reason I'm giving this place five stars! If I was into a whole lot of fish I would have also given this place five stars because it was actually pretty good! It's basically sushi in a bowl.

"My husband booked a weekend at the Mirage this past June for my birthday weekend. We will never stay at the Mirage again. Walking in to the lobby for check in, the hotel looks very nice. However when we got inside of the room it was a completely different story. It looked like our room had not been touched in months. There were crumbs on the floor and thick patches of dust around the mini fridge and bed frame. My husband went downstairs to report it and we were moved to a different room. To my disbelief the second room was no better than the first. Only difference was there were no crumbs this time. 
I refuse to sleep in filth, especially when we are paying $200 a night. My husband went downstairs yet again. This time I went with him. My husband asked if would be possible to have a manager accompany us to see the filth for themselves.The smug front desk rep with a not so friendly attitude said that wouldn't be possible. I explained to him that my husband is an AGM for a major hotel franchise. This is something that would usually take place if a customer has complained about multiple rooms. He than explained to me that the Mirage is SO large of a hotel that no manager would do such a thing. He proceeded to rush us into another room. 
Room number 3 was just as dusty as the first 2 rooms. And there was a random hair on our sheets. We would have moved hotels, but it was hard to find a room at decent rate short notice. At this point my husband and I were tired from traveling and had no more energy to waste. For the duration of our time at the Mirage, I walked around with shoes on. Never setting foot an the carpet. And I slept on top of the fitted sheet, but I could not sleep under the dingy blanket. Lucky we were able to spend most of our weekend out of the room. The bathroom I must say was pretty decent compared to the rest of the room. Which is the only reason I'm giving one start. I've stayed in some very nice hotels. I expected the same quality from the Mirage. But instead received motel quality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",neg

"I spent a few weeks in Edinburgh at a friends house. I loved this whole experience, though I am not much of a big city person. So to find out that they lived a few blocks from the Pentlands was a blessing in my eyes. I started my trek through the Flotterstone Information Center. I grabbed a map, some water, food, and a fully charged camera. I didn't have much of a plan other than summiting the highest peak. As with many of my solo adventures, I didn't bother to look at the map, I found a trial looked for the tallest peak I could see and started walking towards it. I highly recommend not doing this as it's a good way to get lost. The first peak I hiked up to was Turnhouse Hill, at first glimpse it appears that Caplaw or Turnhouse Hill are the tallest peaks, but they are not. You really need to look at the map to find the tallest peak. Once I made it past a few false summits, I could see the next peak, Carnethy Hill. Once again I was sure that Canethy would be the tallest hill, but once I reached the top I could see Scald Law, this was the actual tallest peak. From here I had a snack and decided to actually look at the map. I walked down to the bottom and followed the Road by the lakes to make my way over to Capelaw Hill. The lakes were gorgeous and filled with fly fisherman. I have no clue what they were fishing for other than trout. But many of them seemed to be having luck. Many of the peaks here had older cairns at the top. It would be a good idea to check out the website for this area and come prepared for wet uphill hiking. Here is a link to the land management agency that maintains this area. If you love nature, try to plan a good half day for this park so you don't have to miss out on too much.

My bf & I have been on the hunt for vegan friendly pizza places whenever we're craving some pizza. We tried Pieology but weren't satisfied and luckily I ran upon all the reviews saying that this place had vegan toppings including cheese and meats (chicken and sausage) which was a deal breaker! 

It's only $7.99 for a 12 inch pizza and you get the choice of unlimited toppings. For just $2 extra, the vegan toppings are automatically added to your pizza - such a great deal! We covered it with a bunch of veggies and the pizza was absolutely delicious! 

The sauces (except alfredo and the pestos) are all vegan as well as their choice of crusts (Traditional, Wheat, and Gluten Free). 

There's also plenty of seating in the restaurant and love how it has a ""homey kitchen"" vibe ambiance, just as the name entails. 

We were super happy and will definitely be back soon whenever we need a pizza fix!",pos
"If I was only rating the food, it would be 5 stars. Everything tasted fresh and yummy. 

The restaurant itself, however, is very dirty. From the bathrooms to the menus, there is a layer of grease/filth on everything. Before the food came out, I made a point to wash my hands again and not touch the menu, the seats or the table so I don't get it on my hands. 

The service was mediocre at best. Our server constantly leaned over our food and table and we even had to send back a bowl of rice because his dirty shirt went in it. When we asked for anything extra, it seemed like we were an inconvenience and the server wouldn't even answer. 

Maybe it's just me, but when I see a place this dirty, I don't want to come back. It just makes me picture how nasty the kitchen must be. 

I will definitely not be back.",pos
"Perhaps the most disappointing consumer experience of my life. If I could leave a zero, I would. So much for the customer being right. Clearly, Jesse could not care less about me as a new customer that could have spent quite a sum of money in their store.

As a beginner player, I picked up a used racket on Saturday for my first lesson on Monday. At that point, Pam was great and made a few recommendations and I chose a racket to start. After a dozen balls on Monday evening, the instructor recommended that I move to a lighter racket. The instructor actually goes to the store on Tuesday afternoon and locates a lighter racket that may work. I speak with the instructor on the way to the store and we determine perhaps a better investment at this time may be a good quality pair of shoes and that we revisit the racquet purchase in a couple of weeks. 

I didn't think asking for a store credit in the amount equal to the amount paid for the racket would be an issue. I couldn't have been more wrong! When I arrived at the store, I introduced myself to Jesse and shook his hand. I explained that I would prefer to return the racket for a store credit towards shoes. He said that my instructor picked out a racket and he was not interested in giving me a store credit towards new shoes. His attitude towards me was quite angry.

After another failed attempt to get him to provide a credit towards new shoes I replied, OK, I will take the replacement racket and buy my shoes elsewhere. He then responded by putting the returned racket back up on the counter and saying how 'bout I do this? In other words, take the old racket back. I once again confirmed that he was not willing to provide a credit towards new shoes and his demeanor got much worse. It was at that point I said do the exchange for the replacement racket and I will be on my way. All of this with other patrons in the store hearing and observing the exchange.

To think I could have such a positive experience on Saturday with Pam who helped in every way possible and turn around a few days later and have this experience with Jesse basically supports every negative story about this store that I have heard from other tennis players in the area. I thought I would give them a try and make my own assessment. 

In closing, this store no longer exists in my mind. For Jesse to respond in such a juvenile and unprofessional manner was completely out of line. 

I will never recommend this store to anyone!",neg
