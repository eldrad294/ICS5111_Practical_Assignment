"I CANT MAKE THIS RANT SHORT.... PLS READ ON IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR FUR BABY!

As for me I will never take my ""kids"" here again. Initially the overall appearance and advertised program of this place  is appealing. However, after a stay of two weeks my dog (1 of 2) was picked up with severe matts starting from behind his ears extending down his mane on both sides. In addition, the white portions of his mane, underbelly, and legs are (and remain) stained YELLOW. There is no washing this out (after two shampoos and one professional wash). I've posted picture for everyone to make an objective decision. PET PARENTS BEWARE! 
As many other reviewers have mentioned my little dog too has sores all on her underbelly and my border collie (neglected coat) has green discharge coming from both eyes, fever, lethargy for a period of more than 3 days.
Cindy, stated regional manager, responded in an defensive manner with the overall excuse being... "" there was no instruction to comb his mane"". &(*&)^%!!!.  As a company that brags about its family owned and 10 year establishment status it should well known on how to care for the coat of any pedigree, proper sanitation/infection control, and accountability.

I brought my niece in to purchase her first new car for her 25th Birthday. Her salesman was Mr. Don Turner. He was excellent. He changed my views of a pushy car salesman. He was very professional and took time to here what amenities she wanted in a car. After her purchase of her 2017 Lexus he took time out to show her everything about the car and how the service department work and everything. He did not stop there. My niece then stated Auntie can you get me a bow for my car so I can take a picture for my friends. Mr. Turner went inside and came out with a bow so we can take a picture with it on the top of her car. I have told everyone about my experience. Thank you Mr. Turner of Lexus for making my niece day. From now on Lexus will have all my Business.,pos
"I went here last night with some friends and I am embarrassed by how poorly my group acted under the influence. But, I would like to say that the place was extremely clean, the staff incredibly kind, and in the face of confrontation they were calm, collected, and professional.  They remained rational when people in my group were not.  I know that I would not have been able to hold myself together as well as they did in the situation. I feel awful for not remembering names but the bartender with brown hair and facial hair, our server with glasses and curly blonde hair, and the assistant general manager were awesome.",pos
"My brother was facing serious criminal charges. My family and I interviewed several attorneys before making a decision about who to hire. Ultimately, we hired Bret Royle and his partner Adam. They stayed in touch the entire way and gave our family direct access to them through their cell phone numbers. It was our first time with the court system but in the end, my brother got a great result. Would definitely hire again!",pos
"Sandwiches are delicious. The staff was nice. What more could you want? I got the Italian sandwich and my friend got the lamb meatball one, we gave each other half. Both were equally awesome.",pos
"After a bit of a wait to be seated (busy night), our waiter, Jarrett, went above and beyond what is required to make our night great. He was swamped with other tables, but still spent time to answer our questions and was a fun conversation, as well. I thank him for helping take our night, which could have gone poorly, and making it special.

The food portions are incredibly large, but priced well. Come hungry, or be prepared to have leftovers for the next day or two.

Thanks again, Jarrett!",pos
"Not only does the Wynn pretty much suck compared to just about every other Casino on the strip, it is owned by Steve Wynn, who if you didn't know, is directly responsible for pressing Senator Heller to vote YES on the repeal of the AHCA, thereby stripping tens of millions of Americans of their health insurance. Especially low income and senior citizens on Medicaid!

You see, Steve Wynn is one of the richest men in the world (and as you probably guessed, he's also a HUGE a-hole!) He had a vested interest in the repeal of the AHCA (also known as ""Obama Care"") because the result of the repeal is a significantly reduced tax burden for (drum roll...........) the Richest People in the World! 

SO, as you may know, the good Residents of Nevada are getting more and more liberal, thanks to the City of Las Vegas and Nevada is now a solid ""swing state"". Because of this, ole Senator Heller was torn on how to vote - as his very job could depend on it... Well, then came Steve Wynn, Billionaire to apply the pressure and secure the YES vote on the repeal! Considering 50+1 votes were needed and 50+1 votes were cast - you can honestly say that Steve Wynn is DIRECTLY responsible for this action and the tens of thousands of lives that will be lost due to it. Sure there are others that are complicit as well - but Wynn (as I mentioned earlier) is a real prick too! And honestly, the casino is just meh anyway. 

So, if you're still reading and you're a GOP'er - GOOD FOR YOU! Thanks for your open mindedness! Unlikely I know.... BUT if your a fellow D, a newly minted crossover, just a caring good hearted person, and simply didn't realize Wynn's complicity, please think twice before giving him any of your hard earned money and spend it elsewhere. And if you're going to LV to gamble, Good Luck!!",neg
Went on Steve's junk tour and had a great time! I loved seeing the Rat Rods in person and hearing them run. Highly recommend a visit,pos
"Tasty food, and quick delivery! We received our delivery within 35 minutes of ordering, which was very impressive! Large portions for a very reasonable price! We'll definitely get several meals from this order. I'll definitely order from here again!

We liked the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and plain fried rice. My favorite part was probably the vegetable rolls! Seriously delicious!",pos
Food was good.. after we ordered and received our food we never saw our server again. We had to ask a male server to grab us boxes and our check.,pos
"Have driven by this place, I don't know how many times and finally had a chance to stop by.  Even though my order of combination Pho and amazing spring rolls were to go, the customer service was excellent.    Whenever I go out for Pho I always order Spring Rolls, love them, down side they are usually slightly larger than a traditional egg roll, so I ordered two orders, huge mistake, not really they were huge and delicious one order can be considered a meal.  I am looking forward to a sit down.meal at Viet Noodle Bar in the very near future.  I know I will not be disappointed!",pos
"They have gluten free pasta, but only one option-the corkscrew pasta. I had the shrimp scampi. It was good but a small portion. Service was good. The day we went had $5 wine specials, so that was nice also.",pos
"It is kinda hard to give them 3 stars..... Why? May be bcuz i am from california. I have had better ones. Please see 4 stars of this for vegas LOL

Ambience-pretty nice. Will not accommodate well for 8+groups.

Food-their noodle is hand pulled fresh noodle but it is too soft for my taste

Tried spicy wonton... It's so so...i had it better at tea station. 
And tomato noodle... Made me wonder why they dun have tomato and beef noodle... Too light without meat.
Beef noodle soup-soup is really good. Meat is delicate. You should try it!

Service-pretty quick and nice.",neg
"Going with 4 stars despite the fact the pizza seems a bit bland for a company that calls itself DRAGON FIRE PIZZA! They were at the farmers market today so decided to support the locals trying hard to bring fresh local products to CU. 

They were out of pepperoni so went with the homemade smoked Italian sausage and green/red peppers from the original menu. Kinda bland...could not taste any fennel or red pepper flakes or anything at all for that matter in the sausage. Added jalapeno peppers for some zing but got about a tablespoon of chopped fresh peppers for $1.50 extra which I could not taste. If you want to consistently taste jalapenos use PICKLED JALAPENOS...the fresh ones vary dramatically from scorching hot to nothing...I got nothing this time. 

But I think what is really the problem is that they simply dont use enough salt in the dough or sauce. I know I know...salt is evil, but without proper seasoning you have just plain bland food, especially when using fresh vegis which dont come seasoned! I thought I would fix the problem back at the Hyatt Hotel by adding salt pepper and hot sauce but even then its too late...seasoning must be throughout you just cant put it on top. 

Still give Dragon Fire 4 stars because they are obviously trying very hard and everything is truely fresh but I dont think 5 minutes from ordering to presenting is enough time to crisp the crust and heat the ingredients through. Slices were limp and just barely hot...how bout 7 minutes...I can spare another 2 minutes for a really great crispy crust and flavorable pizza. Worth $11 with the added peppers? - ABSOLUTELY. Give them a try...hope they take some of this to heart. Bravo guys!",pos
"So, I was looking for a place that offered views of the water for my poor (land-locked) mid-western wife.  The views were exceptional!  So, let's get on to the review:

Pros:
If you want flavorful seafood and land-lubber tacos, this is the place.  The tacos are small (think tapas), so order a variety.  My wife ordered on of their ""bols"" (naked burritos) and liked it very much.  But she kept tasting my tacos!  Seriously - one of the pluses of this place is the ability to order a ""flight"" of tacos and not be over-stuffed.  I ordered four different flavors and was not at all disappointed.  I'd tell you the flavors, but I think you should create your own flight.

I did not order the, but, they have a number of reasonably priced sides to add to your entree if you desire - especially if you are splitting entrees.

Cons:
The service was not as slow as some reviews with one caveat:  They place napkins and table ware (forks) in a mason jar on the table.  Our table was out of tableware.  Our waiter and our server couldn't be bothered to bring my wife tableware - they both blamed it on the bus-staff!  Luckily, a neighboring table.  It is clear that real management is so caught up in the back -house operations that they are oblivious to the front house operations.  Ether oversight will eventually doom a restaurant, which the owners seem to not understand, or they simply don't care because liquor sales from this beautiful local offset the lack of restaurant professionalism.",pos
"Horrible doesn't begin to describe my experience on an emergency visit to Long. The vet my dog and I saw had no compassion and he was rough with my 7 1/2 year old lab, all while gruffly informing me she has lymphoma; a shocking diagnosis delivered sternly and without any mind to the devastating blow we were receiving. The doctor pulled my sweet, sick lab to him from across the room by her hind legs for examination (other doctors have always bent down to greet her sweetly). He sputtered a few things AT me, not TO me (it wasn't a conversation, he was addressing me as if I were a brick wall), then left the room abruptly. A vet tech came back in with an itemized estimate for more than $2,500 in tests the doctor didn't bother to explain. Through my tears and disbelief my instincts told me to leave immediately, pausing just long enough to pay the ER fee on my way out the door. It's worth noting that my dog was one of TWO total patients at the ER. This visit wasn't hurried or dismissive because of volume, but rather because of sheer lack of empathy and knowledge of how to do the job. 

It's taken me months to write this review because the experience was so painful. I answered a quality survey from Long just after my visit that expressed these concerns, and I asked to be contacted about my feedback. That was two months ago and they haven't had the decency to reach out to me. The vet we saw has no business in the field and Long is not the reputable institution it once was. 

I'm happy to report my lab is now seeing a WONDERUL team of providers elsewhere, and is in remission. We got the same tests at another clinic for 1/4 of the price, plus 100 times the invaluable compassion, gentleness, hope (& explanations of treatments and costs) necessary in veterinary care. The road has been bumpy but every doctor we've seen after Long (ER vets included!) has been patient, kind, and understanding. Please consider your options when caring for your four legged family members and choose elsewhere for your pet.  I will continue to tell this story to anyone I can and help spread the message!",neg
Drove all the way from Surprise... disappointed by small burned doughnuts  the red light was on which means they are supposed to hot and fresh. What a bummer!,neg
"4/5

Disclaimer: based off the Summerlicious lunch offering 

Came on a Sunday afternoon, around 12:15. Some of us were late for our initial reservation but they were accommodating and we were able to move the time back. The location is very accessible (right from Saks or off of Yonge). 

Ordered the following: 
Veal Carpaccio (App): Veal was nice and tender, and plenty of peppers and onions to match with it. Server recommended this one so thank you! 

Albacore Tuna (Main): Expected a bit more flavor, but the tuna was nice and light, complementing the salty taste of the potato.The vegetables were relatively chewy. 

Panqueques (Dessert): The glaze on the crepe was nice and sweet. Would have made for a 5 star desert if there was ice cream (or something similar) to pair with the crepes. 

The portions were quite big and I found this to be the most value out of my summerlicious ventures. Service was friendly, enthusiastic, and kept joking how we were lucky to make it to the last Summerlicious serving! I don't usually eat South American but am interested in trying more in the future after this.",pos
"Good portions, great food, kinda wish they had more specialty sushi on their menu though.",pos
"Not sure it was worth the price, but the seafood relleno was really good.  No issues with the service either.",pos
Awesome food and service.  Their shredded beef tacos were delicious.  We also had the cheese crisp and it was very good.  Loved the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa.,pos
"DO NOT USE THEM!!!! I'm taking them to court to get my deposit back. They installed the putting green with a seam after I told them no seams and it's the most unprofessional job I have ever seen for 5k. I gave them half up front and when Jeff the sales guy and the foreman came back the next day they both said they had no idea why the crew did a unprofessional job. But being a stand up company that they are Jeff said "" pay us the remaining balance and we will fix it"" yea right like I would ever see them again. I said no and that I would pay them the balance in full once it's fixed. Then he said I'll call my boss. The it was "" pay us $1600 and then we will fix it"" and now we are going to court to get my money back. I have another contractor fixing it in a few weeks and he is in shock how bad of a job LA lawns did. DO NOT USE THEM! You will regret it believe me.",neg
"First time there, food was awesome, and incridble service! Defiently a place to go and bring friends, will be back again. I hade the ceasr salad with chicken, and freshly shreded parmasan cheese with a home made dressing, the chicken was perfectly cooked and tge fresh crutons were a great touch. Their pizza and sause was amazing and their triple chocolate cake was to die for!",pos
"Hannah is a great server and the food is amazing. Be warned, you have to bring your own cheese because they don't have any.",pos
"I usually don't write good reviews because I want to help people when they dont know the places and need to make choices . Today just happened to be in the area , unexpected found this place so decided to give a try .

The seafood fried noodle sauce was too sweet , barely see any seafood except three small shrimps and squid burried underneath the veggies , also too much MSG taste in the sauce . The service was nice and attentive . The restaurant is located next to the cigar shop so there is a strong cigar smell when you walk in . Overall , if you are craving for a Vietnamese food , go to Chinatown!",pos
"Food wise, based on what I had was good. However, I'm not sure why their rating is only 3.5. I think at least they deserve at least 4 stars haha. Hope you guys will enjoy eating at this restaurant:)",pos
"STOLE MY MONEY- 
if i could give them zero stars i would. the only reason they get 1 star is so that i am able to write this review for other to see, before they get ripped off. 
We bought a truck last month. We had an agreement for payments to be taken out every other friday for a month to pay our down payment. They CONTINUE TO TAKE OUR MONEY. When confronted with the proof that we are paid in full, and that they need to stop taking money from us, they hang up on me. They are not refunding our money, and HAVE STOLEN IT. Now i will have to dispute thru the bank and potentially open a fraud case. There is no excuse for the inability to take my phone calls or to attempt to solve the problem. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY.",neg
"Overview_
It's the cheapest taco place you can find in Pittsburgh, and their tacos are actually very delicious. What can you ask for more? =) 

Directions_
Go to the store and say the number of the tacos you want. Cashier will give you a number slip, and just bring it outside to the cook. Choose the meat you want, and it will be served. You add the toppings. 

Note_
Their spicy sauces are EXTREMELY spicy, so be aware. Especially the red sauce can give you stomachache for a while.",pos
"I'm sorry this place is just terrible. 
Walked in with a completely empty place and I know why. Tacos were horrible, corn tortillas were dry as hell, tacos were tasteless. Drinks were ok however the limes were all old and turning dark brown yet they still served them. Bartender was alright but I must say the servers didn't look happy to be here.",neg
"Went here a few weeks ago and will not be coming back.  The staff was nice, but the food is less than mediocre. The kimchi fried rice was very greasy, and the shrimp tempura roll was rolled so loosely that the contents were pretty much falling out.  I don't get how this place is getting such high marks.",neg
I stopped in on friday after a bad day and sat at the bar. The bartender was super sweet and had a lot of good suggestions to offer. She was super friendly and honestly made my day better. Would definitely love to come back with a group of friends. Great atmosphere and good food :) I think my bartenders name was Sara.,pos
"Not recommended unless you get a voucher.  Lets be clear, the shuttle is supposed to run every 45 min, it doesn't.  Closer to 1h25 min! The  hotel does an exchange with Air Canada where they only pay something like $45/night so if you miss your flight with Air Canada and its their fault, don't be surprised to be staying here. However, if I'm on my own dime, I wouldn't stay here. The rooms are OK, better than I expected given the bad service and attitude from the lady that picked us up at the airport.  It is very loud though.",neg
"Brought my 06 mustang in for bumper repair on 7.24.17 and picked it up next day!! Perfect match! As if accident never happened.  Thanks to all the people involved in the repair and Janaya who kept me up to date on scheduling, costs and status of repair.  Fantastic customer service.",pos
Giving East Toyota an update. Today's service was fast! Although they were super busy. The team was moving working fast yet still very respectful on giving great services to their customers! A+!,pos
"Product aside, this establishment has zero sense of empathy, foresight, or compassion. Not providing an ATM as a cash only establishment is inconvenient, but to forcibly take half-eaten ice cream out of a child's hands when their mother promised (and offered collateral) to run to the bank to grab cash and come back is ridiculous. Bad community relations and practices, and performing a potentially traumatic and embarrassing experience to a child is unacceptable. No ice cream is worth shaming a child over a simple and easily reconcilable mistake.",neg
"Unbelievably good. An amazing atmosphere and great food!  It was a totally incredible experience dining in an incredible space.  The food is fancy, but good-sized portions and tastes amazing!",pos
The spicy miso ramen is a little bowl of heaven. This is my go-to ramen place that is light years beyond your college Maruchan days.,pos
"Amazing service! Two new air conditioners on my roof already blowing cold air. 

I needed to replace (2) old air conditioners for the home I just bought. The old a/c's were in terrible shape. They were using a lot of electricity and could not keep the house cool. I wanted to get new Seer 14 energy efficient air conditioners.

I scheduled Air Supply to replace the A/C's. The guys started unhooking my old A/C's at 9am, had the crane lift the new A'C's into place at 11am and the job was complete at 12:30pm.

Thanks for such great service! I 100% recommend Air Supply.",pos
"Best gym I've ever joined. Brittany and Maddie are always friendly and helpful.
So glad my Family joined.",pos
They had very little topping choices compared to other joints like this. Also my boyfriends pizza was so burnt he couldn't eat more than half of it.,neg
Took my Goldendoodle to Groomer Has It for bath and haircut.  Breanna did an excellent job!  She did not poodle my doodle! :-)  I showed her a picture and she did exactly what I asked.  My doodle looked and smelled great! Even his teeth were so white! I found a perfect groomer!  Very happy!,pos
"NVWM realty is is AMAZING. Everyone that I had the pleasure to work with truly accommodated my every need!!! Their service and dedication to their customers are second to none and really exceeded my expectations. Unlike many other firms in Vegas, they are very prompt and quick to respond to any inquiries I may have had. They remained professional at all times which is something I look for when searching for homes. I recommend this firm to everyone, trust me you will not regret it!!!!",pos
this place is the BEST! Daniel does an amazing job with my nails and I don't think I can every see anyone else. They get really busy so make sure to make an appointment.,pos
"Billy Bishop Airport is the poor cousin of Pearson Airport, it being a small regional alternative to its bigger peer. It almost has the feel of a bus depot than an airport. But it's convenient enough, with shuttle bus taking you to downtown. Not that it's as convenient as the train shuttle at Pearson, but hey, it's free, and you can't beat that. Generally, when I have time on hand, I tend to choose Billy Bishop over Pearson.",neu
Olive & IVY is my favorite place to eat and hang out in all of Scottsdale. I live in Nebraska but my daughter lives in Scottsdale and every time I visit her we go to Olive and Ivy. The atmosphere is terrific and I love sitting out on the patio in the cooler months.The food is always great!,pos
Absolute crap. The beds are horrible. Both my partner and I are in excruciating pain from the horrible mattress. We complaoned about the qualoty of the pillows and mattress and looked at us and said...well we can't do much. They shouls switch the name to Town inn Dumps,neg
"The atmosphere is good. But this place is a lot different than other Phoenix restaurants. You must order in the front first. Then you go up to the front and grab your food. The price isn't cheap,so don't expect to get filled for bring less than $10. Overall it's a good place. But the reason why I gave it 3 stars because of the price. It's more expensive than other Phoenix restaurants.",neu
"Went to Top Golf this weekend with some friends wanting to check out a new fun place. We were not disappointed at all! No, the parking is not super convenient, however, some walking when on the strip should be expected, and it IS Vegas... it's hot here. When we got there around 930 on a Saturday night we were informed there would be an hour wait for a bay so we put our name in and went to one of the many bars inside the facility. Great service and good drinks. Our bay was ready earlier than 1 hour and once in the bay we had an awesome time! The guy who showed us to our bay was very friendly and knowledgeable and our server was on top of our drink situation the whole 3 hours we were there. We ordered the BBQ platter and the food was delicious and plenty for all 6 of us to share. Let's not forget the main attraction, the golf! So fun competing in the games against everyone and great club options to use. Bonus points locals get 20% off, so for a locals night out definitely 5 stars!",pos
"First time here and it was overall delicious! Place was nice and clean. Several choices of meat and veggies to chose from. They also had 4 types of sauces and 2 types of crust. Staff was nice and helpful. Flavors were good and the fact on Tuesday you can have any and all toppings for $6, is the way to go!

Knocking off two stars because my friends pizza had hair. It seemed as if it was in the dough and not a random flyaway. Nonetheless, that was disgusting!

Hopefully the next time we go there won't be anymore hair in the dough.",pos
Thanks staff was super friendly and welcoming but I won't be returning. We are new to the state so I brought my dog to get established and a prescription for his anxiety (something he has had for a long time) I was told about $45 for the visit. They brought me a bill for over $440 expecting me to pay for it without even offering and explaining everything. I declined everything but it really made me feel like they only care about the money. The Dr was even talking to me about other things that weren't even an issue as if trying to find more to charge me for. I am very disappointed in our visit and will be finding someone who actually cares about my pet and not only the money.,pos
Yes yes yes !!!!! Fish is fantastic - moist on the inside and a beautiful fry to finish !!!! Shrimp is just as good - big and juicy too!!! Didn't get a chance to try the fries but as they tossed the garlic fries my mouth was watering.,pos
This place reminded me of a pub back where I live in Northwest Indiana aka or the region. Any way the food is great and staff was wonderful. Especially loved live entertainment and outdoor games. Great job continue with the great work. I'll be coming back there when I have a chance. Thank you staff and management for making me feel at home with your establishment.,pos
This is the worst customer service ever. I tired to cancel my flight within 24 hours amd they refused to process as they said it passed 24 hours. It is not ture. Their system has flaws and made mistake. I tried to explain to 2 different agents that i have the email to prove that it was still within 24 cancellation period but they refused to listen and refuse to help and kept accusing me how wrong I was.....Then I called Alsaka airline directly and cancelled the ticket without any additional cancellation fee becuase I cancelled within 24 hours!!!. I have never experienced any customer service worst than this. Not only refusing to listen but accusing customer to be wrong. I will never purchase anything from this company and make sure all my friends know what happened.,neg

"This is THEE best Thai place in Phoenix.... or maybe in my life! And no, I haven't been to Thailand so that means the best I have in the United States! 

NO JOKE! I go here so often, I know the staff. I got so often, I have brought at least 12-15 new people with me and recommended it to at least 6 clients who have gone by themselves. I go so often that I sometimes run into other people I have gotten hooked on the place! I have gone on my birthday! I have brought out of town visitors there! I being clients, friends, family and co-workers!!!

I honestly shouldn't have to tell you how good to food is after the above. But here goes: IT'S FABULOUS! Fresh, made to order, even their rice! So good, delicious, and SUPER VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! 

Honestly, worth trying- you won't be sorry. Poi and her wonderful staff will do a great job taking care of you!!!!!",pos

"I'm a 1750 hour CFI. This place sells groupons for simulator rides, so if that's your game, enjoy the video game. But, if you're a real pilot I'd recommend another FBO. To give you an idea, when I asked my flight instructor, Sean, about his flight experience, he actually used his dad's military service on his resume'! So sad... Hell, my dad was a surgeon, doesn't make me one. That was the best part of my experience at this place. I've been been stood up for flights and had planes cancelled hours before a family trip and just an overall feeling they don't give a sh#t.

Run!!!!!!!",neg
"I did NOT stay in this hotel. However, walking around it was enough to know it deserves one star or less. It has a terrible smell, very dirty, and very dark. The smoke smell seemed stronger here than anywhere else. Maybe this is because it's so old and doesn't have as good of a ventilation system as some of the other hotels? We came to see the middway/shows but we couldn't stay long as the smell was making my mother sick. I actually think the Circus Circus in Reno is nicer.",neg
"Visions by David is awesome! This family business has an extensive portfolio of timeless images. Not only do they have an award winning reputation, but they also have such fun personalities which would make the photo shoot experience that much more enjoyable. As a bride raving how happy I am with how my pictures turned out, I'm confident the memories they capture for others will keep them smiling for a lifetime.",pos
"A legit boba shop in Henderson. Finally!! I was able to sample several different flavors during their BOGO. My favorite ones were the coconut thai tea, black coffee with sea salt, and wintermelon milk tea! 

The drinks are made well, but my taro slush and okinawa milk tea were a bit off from what I am used to.

Toppings: good. Boba up to par with the more popular spots. Grass jelly, melt in your mouth goodness. 

They have fruity teas and slushies that are so refreshing! I love the chamango drink, but wished there were more blended mango in there!

They have an electronic system to earn a reward. Pretty typical, if you buy 10, get one free. 

I like the decor of the place, it's definitely done well; however, it's not really a stay and hang out kind of place.",pos
After some extremely unpleasant experiences with various AC companies I have finally found the one I want to do business with. Chris is a specialist in his craft and is very friendly and genuine person. I highly recommend Bond Heating and Air Conditioning!!!,pos
"Food was decent, but getting any kind of service was a chore. After standing awkwardly at the entrance for an uncomfortable amount of time we were told to sit anywhere. Chose a high top and waited while servers walked by, passing us off to each other. Finally got one who took our drink order, then disappeared. When she brought our drinks, she asked if we wanted menus. We ordered, but the beer and appetizers were served at the same time as the meal. We still didn't have napkins or silverware, and the runner said we'd have to ask someone else for that because he didn't know where it was. The order was wrong and never corrected. Still waiting to see our server and get the check so we can head out and never come back. There's someone arguing with another server that he wants his ID returned, so at least that's entertaining.

There's so much focus on the daily events that service feels like an afterthought. Big mistake.

Update: Got the bill and we were overcharged. Surprise.",neg
"Hostess never smile and made us feel unwelcome, food was ok, beer was nice and cold, service was friendly but needs some work. Busser was very friendly and doing most of the work. Place looks clean I hope next time I give five stars.",neu

"Today marks 1 year that I've been coming in to this place and I'm so glad I came in. I found a new place to come to every few weeks after my last nail of 7 years retired from doing nails.  I'm so glad I have a new place to come to. The new owners took over this place at the beginning of July 2016. 
They always have good selection of  glitter gel colors which I always go with in a fade or ombre style. I especially Love that i can go almost 3 weeks before coming in again. I don't always get a pedicure, but when I do, my time there is a relaxing time for nails and a pedicure day. 
Andrew and Jennifer are both knowledgeable and very easy to communicate with. I always look forward to my Nail day. 
Thank you for always making my nails look beautiful, fresh, and new everytime.",pos
It's a scary place where males that are shirtless and only ordering water and glaring at female patrons while sitting on patio and spending inordinate times in bathroom,neg
The food was delicious and came out pretty fast. I had the chicken and waffles with apple compote and almost fell asleep after eating it. It was so worth it though! The service wasn't the best but the place is always packed. I highly recommend it!,pos
"I arrived around 7:50 I wanted the gel polish soaked off because they've turned brown before my birthday trip to Miami. My whole purpose of getting gel was to maintain the crisp white clean look, she then said well makeup can change the nails she didn't say that before. I sat down by this time and 30/40 minutes passed by whole time asking her to get the foil to soak off the gel she ignored me when I sat in the chair for my pedicure the lady was concentrating on everything but my feet the polish is awful I didn't see it until I got home I then was approached I the owner/cashier saying that I needed to come back tmrw she needed to get home to her babies and I was instantly furious because she could have told me that earlier and I could have went elsewhere I said I wasn't going anywhere and I wont paying for anything until I got a full service some man then began to ask me if I wanted him to call security I simply told him that idgaf who you call by this time they had 5/7 nail techs cleaning ready to go they didn't care if I was satisfied only ready to leave there customer service is horrible and I will be going for them to fix my toe for F R E E ! but they will not be getting anymore of my money !

What a great breakfast/ lunch place that even offers catering! The owners here will walk up and greet you personally. The menu for both breakfast and lunch is extensive. You'll want to go back again and again to try the different offerings. In addition they deliver to local businesses and the restaurant  offers free WiFi! Nice place to eat and keep up with work. The ambience is done as an old 50's diner with all the Coca-Cola memorabilia. And the service staff is friendly and helpful. This is a must try!,pos
Wonderful service! So responsive! Reasonably priced! Great final product! Quick turnaround! Would definitely use again! Highly recommend!,pos

"We have been sitting here for about 45 minutes, and they're not anywhere close to our number. This is considered fast food to me, so I don't know why it takes THIS LONG. It is absolutely ridiculous!! The food isn't good enough to wait this long. It's hot inside the restaurant, they play (what sounds like) the same song over and over again and we're thinking of just leaving because who has a free hour and a half to wait around for tacos??",neg
"This little mom and pop establishment can be easily missed as it sits in the shadow of a condo complex on a fairly quiet corner of the 7th Ave and Thomas St intersection.  I have heard about this place from several people. The name of the establishment is rather memorable in a funny way...  ""Long Wong""....  *giggles*  So, of course, I've always wanted to try the wings out.   

I ordered the 12 wing plate and fries.  The fries were not very good to me or my friend.  In fact, my friend didn't eat the fries... I was a little hungry so I had more than a few of them.  They weren't very good.  Plenty of the reviews reported how quickly the wings come out... This I can say is quite true.  I am not sure I was in my seat more than 5 minutes before they were calling me.  The wings themselves were severely overcooked with little to no flavor.  I prefer my wings to be sauce-less so I can dip them.  This means your chicken wing has to have some seasoning and taste good plain.  Unfortunately, these wings don't taste like they have any seasoning on them before they are cooked.  If the wings themselves don't taste good stand alone (without sauce), it is difficult for me to enjoy the wings.  However, the sauce on the flavorless wings was good.  .


People swear these are the best hot wings in Phoenix.  I beg to differ.

"I started searching for the best deal I could find on a Santa Fe with dealerships in Las Vegas, Utah and Los Angeles and found that deal here.  Due to my work, which kept me in LA for several weeks, I had to arrange the deal by phone and email and fly in on a Saturday to do the deal.  I had some trepidation about buying a car this way but Tony and Allan did exactly what they said they would do, the deal was exactly as they had quoted and it was the best deal I found out of several Hyundai dealerships in three states.  Allan even picked us up at the airport!  I've never had a better experience buying a car.",pos

"Since one of the earlier bartender, Amy, was so consistently good it's tough to have a poor girl that seems unhappy to be there.  This newer bartender is competent and will get your drink but no conversation or even 'how's it going tonight?'  And I'm talking about during an empty bar and just few people at the tables, 3 couples.  It's been this way for the last year. I've mentioned her lack of personality to others that were working and they nod and say 'sorry'.  The happy hour used to be packed- no room at the bar with regulars and new comers, but now very few people are ever there.  I'm a big fan of the laid-back personality but not in this type of bar setting.  I like this spot better than Ladera but over and over we are disappointed with the lack of personality with the entire place.  There is a very sweet table server  that chats with everyone and brings a bit of life to the experience. Please, please - new bartender!?!  I hate to see this spot close but they must be losing business.",neu
Cold Stone's is like my other favorite ice cream place to go to pretty much always the same thing like I said I don't like change its the strawberry blonde which is really good birthday cake remix even when it's not my birthday and there was one that I made up a long time ago but now they don't have it I called it a Dublin mudslide. But they don't have all the ingredients to make it so they're missing the coffee ice cream it's like a chocolate coffee ice cream that I loved and add Brownie and caramel and hot fudge  sauce,neu
"I've always been phobic of dentists but Dr. Naik and her staff have helped me overcome my phobia.  First of all, her office is decorated in such an elegant manner, which creates a welcoming atmosphere.  Her staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Dr. Naik has such a gentle touch and really provides care in a manner to ease my phobic nature.  I guess that explains why she's been profiled as a Top Dentist for many years.

"Wow so bad. More to follow. Yelp will not allow me to post this as a tip
This place has been completely awful. I am referring to the orthopedic unit at this hospital. 
I want to start off by rehashing the past.  I needed to have or supposedly need to have ulnar nerve transposition.  I had the surgery and nerve surgery is one of the most painful procedures one can have.  I was not warned of this or treated for this. I was told I would be good in 2 weeks. Wrong . I learned about this after the fact.  I did not do my research was my fault.  Coming out of surgery my elbow was on fire.  I was persribed Celebrex . That was not enough or even correct for the type of surgery I had.  Crazy pain. So when i paged my so called surgeon's  line the nurse told me to double my Celebrex doses. Well I did this and when  ran out 2 weeks later they would not give me more.  Right, non narcotic request for pain control and was denied. I had to ask my PCP for a non narcotic pain medication because my surgeon was pretty much incompetent .  Dr. Shaffer was the dude, avoid if possible

Fast forward now 7/25/17, I have double torn meniscus and I am back at UH because of my PCP is UH. I go to the same orthopedic office and  keep an open mind. But the same shit starts happening. I am not getting the full story. I did not receive a copy of my MRI result till afterward i was told i needed surgery.  The Dr that was reading my MRI results had a copy that referred to BOTH my right knees.(Yes Both)

I then called the office and asked to have surgery and they could only book 3 weeks out(which to my understanding is not bad). I then called and asked if i could get crutches and the admim person advises i would be better off with a walker (I can still walk and function, just not a lot of pressure on one knee). I finally got the script for crutches (I think). I also asked for scrip for  a handicapped spot so i do not have to deal with stairs as my job only has a parking garage with stairs. They seemed to ignore this.",pos
"I would not recommend this office for children. One of the front desk employees was very friendly and helpful, the other was rude. The MA that did the initial evaluation with my son had no patience what so ever. My son is 6 and obviously children require more explanation and guidance. She was getting extremely frustrated that he couldn't keep his eyes wide open without moving them. She expected him to be able to do it quickly and unfortunately it made her extremely frustrated that he needed multiple chances to do it properly. She was rude and not explaining anything to him in a way that a child could understand. The Dr was slightly better, but also lacked the patience needed to deal with children. Due to his lack of patience I am also questioning his evaluation and will now need to get a second opinion. After we finished the exam and were looking at frames, another employee came up to us, basically rushing me to choose. I opted to get the RX and will order glasses elsewhere. Overall it was a very poor experience, lacked professionalism and they really shouldn't be booking pediatric exams if they can't have a little extra patience with a young child. I will not be returning.",neg

Also took advantage of their egg roll deal on yelp and it's ok, but I'm not big on egg rolls. Ordered the beef chow mein and shrimp fried rice, which both are really big portions and delicious, so definitely worth the price!",pos
"Cute little place.  Went twice, once on a weekend and once on a weekday. On a weekend you might have to wait a little while for a table it was pretty packed. But on a weekday there should be no wait. I'd say it's pretty reasonably priced. The service was kind of slow when we went on a weekend but that's expected. The waitress kept us loop as to why it was taking long and offered us some free food, can't remember what she offered but she was very nice. The second time it was kind of slow and there weren't a ton of people there. The waitress was a mess. She forgot my drink. Didn't ever come back to get us more water or drink refills. And she switched our orders with another table. There was only 2 of us. Shouldn't have been as complicated as she made it. Not a pleasant second experience. I liked the country fried steak. Ordered it both times.",pos
Had a great experience here. Our server Nancy was excellent and gave our party great recommendations. We had wonderful glasses of cabernet to complement our awesome Italian food.

My favorite part of the meal was the bread that came with an amazing green chutney sauce.",neu
"Tasty food, several good vegetarian options, and thoughtful service. We stumbled on this place while on our way to a different restaurant and decided to give it a try by just ordering snacks. The restaurant is clean and comfortable inside, although the music was just a touch loud (all hard surfaces in there). I enjoyed a mojito with plenty of fresh lime and mint, and also ordered the garlic-marinara seats, which is a dish of mushrooms with peppers and tomato. The vegetables were bright and flavorful and the bread (drizzled with olive oil and grilled) was delicious. My husband got the casserole Zandru's which he really enjoyed.",pos

"4 years ago we purchased a home In Maricopa with serous pigeon issues. They responded to my request and within a few weeks they took care of the problem, they put up spikes, wired all nesting areas and wired  all the edges of our one story home. All the best and droppings were cleaned up! Never had another issue until we put up solar panels with Solar City, because it's a guarantee with any roof issues with Solar City I called them, they sent The Pigeon Guy to remove the nest, I was really happy to know they were coming to take care of! The best we're removed from under the panels and wires put up around them to prevent more nesting. And again all the droppings were cleaned up. Having such great results and service I recommended them to my daughter In Queen Creek , they were scheduled to come to her home 7/5 but never showed up or returned any of her calls. I felt bad that they didn't show up so I called and also left them a message asking them to please contact her, but they never did. I would love to give them a 5 star rating because they do good work. My daughter also had suggested them to their friends who just built a large home and was looking for someone to take care of their pigeon issues, but has since let them know they never showed up or returned calls.",pos

The last time we went, it was a nightmare, they took about 20 minutes to take our order, we patiently waited until we noticed they started serving the table next to us with four people that arrived about 20 minutes after we did, I called the waiter who looked at me with a annoyed face while he walked away, he didn't come to our table so I had to yell to ask about our food. A couple of minutes later someone else comes out of the kitchen with our waitress to explain that they lost the order while he was holding it on his hand saying ""do you want to wait or....? So we left those delicious tacos and salsas behind because we were too hangry to wait one more minute and they didn't offer us free chips to eat more salsas...  the food is really good the service is really shitty..",neu

"Dining at Carson's was unique for two reasons: one, dishes were featured in small platters so that we could get a taste of each without it ever growing old on us; two, our family got to share dishes, rather than eating a plate each, making it a delightful ""family night"" experience. Although a bit on the pricey side, it was well worth the 30 minute walk.",pos

According to the coupon alcohol was not counted toward the discount, so it should not have mattered.

What a bait and switch if ever I heard this!  We will not be back and I will also let social media  know how you handle these situations as well.  So unfair and what is the point of the coupon. Better add this information to your useless coupon prior to us ordering drinks and also during dinner time. You don't keep long time customers by treating them this way.  No Class!",neg

Their picadillo salad that comes with many dishes is very refreshing and flavorful. Both times I've been there, the guy behind the counter taking the orders was super friendly and helpful in explaining what the dishes were. Really good customer service!",pos
"Oh my gosh, I love Crazy Pita and I frequent all three of the locations in town. This is truly a local business, with a trio of locations owned by one guy. All three have their strengths and weaknesses, but all three serve absolutely delicious food. 

If you're looking for healthy eats, this is your place. Sure, you can get a plate of french fries if you must, but the grilled skewers, Mediterranean vegetables, hummus with olive oil, Greek salad, and fluffy couscous are good for your body! My go-to here is the mixed skewer plate ($15) with chicken and shrimp. The plate comes with a hearty skewer of grilled chicken breast, a skewer of grilled shrimp, couscous with tasty veggies (including squash and zucchini), an amazing feta salad (topped with olives, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta), and a little side of hummus with pita bread (white or whole wheat). 

The portions may be hearty but the prices certainly are hefty. I like to eat here before or after a movie and dinner for two with sodas runs a little over $40.00 with tax. That's almost as much as eating at a sit-down full service restaurant!

But as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and the food is seriously top notch. Quality ingredients make for a happy tummy. I've also noticed that the employees at all the locations are a cut above most fast food workers. Think In-N-Out quality employees.  

There are a couple of minor negatives, however. First, let's talk about the hummus. I know Crazy Pita probably has wants to have dumbed-down hummus that appeals to non adventurous eaters, but their version is pretty lame. It's also so watery and thin that it doesn't even taste like or resemble traditional hummus (I want thick hummus topped with olive oil)! They do provide a communal olive oil container by the soda machine, but it's low quality oil, or at least it tastes like it. Second, I really, really hate how when you place an order at the register and pay via credit card, the system automatically prompts you to add a tip. A tip? For what?! I despise how so many places are guilt tripping customers into tacking on 20% or more to reward a person for simply doing their job. I have to tip someone taking an order? No thanks.

Overall Crazy Pita is the tops. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Yes, it's expensive and can get pricey really quickly (if you order soda or sides). But give it a try, I know you'll love it!",pos
"It's alright, cozy atmosphere, and is one of a very few tea/coffee places in the area that's open past 10pm (with barely any crazy people inside).

I consider my mom a coffee enthusiast. She said the aroma of the coffee was one of the best she has ever smelled. It was also freshly brewed so no cream and sugar was needed. My mom and I shared the chicken and mushroom crepe and it was more than enough. We actually stayed full the whole entire day! My boyfriend and my sister ordered the same sandwich and they both pretty much kicked their plates clean. 

Can't give it a full 5 stars due to the service lacking. It was hard to get a hold of our waiter and he didn't really check up on our table. 

I would definitely come back!",pos
"Went here due to their great reviews. Would never recommend this facility to anyone of my pet owning friends. When scheduling I was told my dog would cost $127.50 for her spay and that was with the new customer discount and assuming my dog weighed under 25Ibs. Upon arriving my dog weighed more than expected so I was prepared to pay the 20 or 30 dollar price difference, they also stated that the vaccine record I brought in said she was due for a vaccine update and asked if I would like to update her, I agreed assuming it was a normal one shot booster. When I came after work to pick my pup up and pay the bill it was $279!?! I payed the balance and then requested the invoice with the breakdown of her visit, they gave her every vaccine they could, the front desk gave us a wrong price on the phone (they quoted us for a nueter, not a spay), they also didn't include the 15% discount for being a new customer. When I started to get upset due to the complete lack of organization and communication Christina the front office employee became snarky and rude. She asked me why I even let her take the payment... 100% unprofessional. I am even more appalled at the manager Jim, who I was told to contact the next day to discuss a partial refund for services I wasn't aware they were rendering, a refund of $18.50 for the collar, and apply the 15% discount to my bill. While discussing my concerns on repeated vaccines (specifically her rabies vaccine which is the 3 year, and its recommended they have another at 1 year, not required so why was it given) and employee communication I received a completely disinterested response from him, at one point he asked me why I was ""blaming"" the front staff and the doctor (who was supposed to counsel us on her medication, but forgot due to the present complaints from myself) for the mistakes and said that he was being blunt and honest by telling me I should take some accountability for not understanding my pets vaccine record and not requesting an elaboration on what her updates on vaccines entailed before agreeing. He then stated that he felt we were just talking in circles and that he needs to know what I want. I told him the 18 for the collar because I did not take it home, the 3 vaccines that are recommended to update, again not required, and the 15% discount to be applied to the total bill, he said ok and to come in at my earliest convenience for the refund. I told him I work until 5 and would be by then. When arriving at the vet the manager was not there, which seemed very disrespectful due to the level of pissed off these guys made me already, again the other staff was great, but Christina was just as rude as the first encounter. She walks by as the other front desk woman was handing me my receipt and sets a vaccine information sheet for the rabies-3 next to her hand and says that's for her, didn't look at me one time. Then laughs and walks off, I thank Christina and let her know that I won't be needing it and I'm fully aware of the vaccine and its indications (I happen to manage a doctor's office that is state registered to administer vaccines) she smirks and walks off around the corner. I can't tell you how unprofessional and disheartening this whole ordeal was. I will never recommend this facility to any pet owner. They are disorganized, very rude, and the professionalism is absent all the way up to the manager.",neg

I was an assistant manager working for them for almost 7 months. I was salaried, so I expected to work more hours than anyone, it's inherent in a salary...however, what I did not expect was to work between 115-130 hours per pay period every single pay period therefore making my calculated hourly wage at around $8.90-$9.60...less than the current minimum wage. The ONLY reason I worked that hard for that long with that low of a calculated wage, was that I was promised a promotion from day one, it's even in the offer letter I have. I continuously asked for support, which I never received, and feedback, to which I was told ""you're doing great, be more assertive with the employees"" and that's it. Basically, I had a bad month, lost a close family member, and had my car impounded, as a result I called off sick twice. Instead of them giving me a warning or telling me that this wasn't working for them...or maybe offering a helping hand in a time of need...they decided to terminate me without thought.
 Now, the problems with the handling of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant are terrible. I have pictures, which I will post, of every time I came in to open the store how AWFUL a condition it was left in each night. There was standing water left under the sinks and counters, mixed in with food and other things, the pads which the gluten free and high rise dough are put directly on to cook weren't cleaned off at all each night, just put back into a pan dirty (which the only cleaning that took place with these mats anyways was to wipe them down with a paper towel), the drain for the beer tap was not cleaned each night, causing little fruit flys and larvae to gather all around the drain each night. The trash cans were never cleaned out, building up with terrible odors underneath the bags. The mops were never wrung out and hung upside down in the mop sink as they were SUPPOSED to be, causing more flies in the back area.
  Another MAJOR issue is that the female night managers didn't take any temps as required by the company and the health Dept, and leave the daily temp logs blank...when bringing this to the attention of my Manager, she would just have those managers go back and pencil whip the temps and signatures from time to time. I continuously brought these issues to the attention of my Managers, Summer, Joe, and Kyra, telling them that I needed support, and that I was tired and burned out, and needed some support and needed a management  team that was on the same page and working together, however, they did nothing about it. They brushed it off because they didn't like me for some reason. Again, trying so hard to fix these issues, trying so hard to work towards a better, cleaner store, and I was the one to get let go because I had a bad month. If you value a clean establishment that treats their employees well and follows health codes, policies, and procedures... don't go here.",neu
Came here for breakfast. Great food especially for the cheap price and great ice chai. A bit confusing that you have to order from the counter then get service to your table. We sat at the open bar outside. There is plenty of shade when it is sunny out. Decor indoors is also nice. It reminds me slightly of the types of restraunts/bars in downtown in Europe. Still need to come back for dinner.,neu
"I love East Side Mario's but this location was the worst...restaurant I have ever been to!! The host was a bit eccentric but that wasn't the issue until I told him that we were ready to order, after being seated for 15 minutes with no one to check on us. He freaked out a little and said he doesn't take any orders and that our server would be with us very shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed, I stopped another server and asked for our server because we were ready to order. Few mins later she came by with bread told us our server was still busy (for the past 30+ minutes) and ONLY took our drink orders. My friend and I chatted some more finished, we finished bread and another 10+ minutes passed...we still haven't gotten our drinks or our server.  At this point we've waited for over 40 minutes and we decided to leave. The shittiest part was we watched 2 tables that came after us got serviced before we did. 

Don't recommend this location, will never go back! And I work in food and beverage lol!",neg

"This was my second visit, and i ordered a medium boneless with two different sauces for takeout. They didn't even go over my order and with 30 minutes waiting time, I just assumed everything will be correct and came home. I opened the two boxes and they were the same flavor.. They had everything on the receipt correct... I guess it was the kitchens fault.",pos
"Choosing the right window treatments is critical, both for function (privacy, room darkening effects) and for contributing largely to the overall style of a home. It's also a design element that typically lasts the duration of the time you live there, so it's important to get it right. The House of Window Coverings was the right company to guide us in this process. Their employees were thoroughly professional, punctual and courteous. In particular, Karen, who made a visit to our home prior to our install, seemed more like our personal interior designer than a person offering a consultation. She has such tremendous experience in helping clients select their window coverings, but beyond that, she is genuinely passionate about her work. Her knowledge of design, scale, balance and colors was phenomenal. Her sincerity and concern for my family was obvious. She let my husband and I ask a million decorating questions and offered us wonderful suggestions and ideas to pull together all the elements of our house. We found her simply invaluable.  Her years in the business informed her that in order to offer us the right window coverings, she needed to know our preferences and general personalities so she could help us express it in our home.  She specifically knew exactly what kind of window coverings would offer us privacy on our sliders without compromising our city view, - a view which was a big reason we bought the house originally. In our case, Hunter Douglas Luminettes were the perfect answer. They were an answer we hadn't found on our own search and they were truly an ingenious curtain option.  We are so glad we met Karen and found our unique and contemporary solution. It's overwhelming to decorate a whole house, but, thanks to The House of Window Coverings, we had one less problem to conquer.  And, thanks to the sweet way Karen had with assisting us, we knew she truly cared about our results as much as we did.",neu
"On my usial business trip-induced quest for fiber before my flight back to The Big Crapple, my wife suggested I try Living Kitchen (she now insists she didn't, but that's a reflection on our marriage, not the restaurant).  

The restaurant is in what looks like a recently Milenn-trified part of town, you know, where they renovate an old factory or warehouse into what is effectively a post-modern mall where the self-conscious bourgeois hyperenlightened masses can bask in luxury while evading micro-aggressions in a wholesome, nonjudgemental safe space.

I ordered the Fire and Brimstone burger and a beet salad.  Both were pretty good, although way short on the fire for a region so famous for its BBQ.

I am sure many other people have commented on the languid service.

I'm not in the free management consulting industry, but I'll offer my keen insight.  The main reason why the service is as laconic as it is, is because customer service is not part of the conception of the business.  

The food, decor and even the customer demographic is finely honed, but as a workplace, the vibe is more a relaxed work environment geared to pleasant working conditions than a passionate dedication to excellence.  

Surveying the staff, I could not identify anyone that ancient people used to call a manager.

In any case, if you like ""raw"", nutritious bohemian fare and your time is not that valuable to you, you could do somewhat worse than this ultra-contemporary. Yupstaurant.",pos
"Came here for lunch and couldn't be happier (or fuller). Pork adobo, Thelma's special (lechon pork with tomatoes, onions, and a soy sauce-based sauce), and pork gisante with rice, macaroni salad. and garlic rice.

Get your intro to Filipino food here, and you won't be sorry.",pos
Had a good experience with the server who first greeted us but soon after we got harassed by a second server as well as the owner of the restaurant when trying to order a drink. After showing three forms of identification (because we are from out of state) The server litteraly yelled at us to the point where we got up and walked out without ordering a thing. I've never experienced such terrible customer service before in my life. They are rude and do not treat their customers with any respect. I would expect a lot more from a place like this. I wish I could give them less than one star.,pos

"(Through Ubereats) Ordered the carne asada tacos w/ rice and beans and horchata... everything was heavily ""seasoned"" with salt! The rice was also heavily undercooked. The horchata wasn't too bad, but it was essentially an iced chai latte. Not sure if I'd give this place another shot.",pos

Amazing place! I had been to many different tattoo shops looking for a tattoo I wanted and didn't love the people or places enough. I had given up when I saw this place and went inside to see.

It was very clean and all the people were very nice. I'm defidently coming here for all my other tattoos!,pos
"We were given a recommendation from our neighbor to come here. The cashier at the front was really helpful when I told her we had never been there before. She was able to explain some things and give us her recommendations. We thought that the beef was better than the chicken, the salsa was spicy and yummy, and the chocolate chimis were delicious. It's a semi-sweet chocolate, probably just chocolate chips, but chocolate deep fried in a tortilla is always delicious!",pos

"Love, love this store. I stop in everytime I go to the mall and get something. They let you try out so many of their products and you always leave smelling really good.

Pricing seems very high but bombs and other bath bars, oils and bubbleroons can be broken up for several uses which makes pricing very reasonable.

The kids get their ""rainbow"" moldable soap. Great as a bath color changer, soap or shampoo. I usually cut each color into 4ths. I also get them the ""ickle baby bot"" which has lavender and chamomile great for before bedtime.

I personally like the melts or luxury bath oils. They leave your skin so soft. Plus the melts arent fizzy like the bombs.

They have a ton of other products from make up, facial cleaners, shampoo, conditioners and products for men. 

Lots of staff at this location and they are super helpful and friendly.",pos

The Peppermill is a 24/7 must for the Vegas visitor looking for the taste and feel of Old Vegas. Bright, lively and always open The Peppermill will not disappoint if you're looking for a great drink (or 5) and some solid diner food.

The sampler platter was okay.

Our Blue Hawaiians were super tasty!

Our server, Kaitlyn, was attentive, helpful, and on top of all our needs even though she was skillfully dealing with a large table of 16 people while taking care of us at the same time. We tipped her well but should have tipped even more! Thank you Kaitlyn!

Probably my favorite taco place in Las Vegas but those lines be extra long. If you're in a rush pass it up but if you have time defiantly try some good fresh tacos. The lines are a bit confusing too.

"The Industrial was the perfect venue for my birthday party! It was one of the best nights of my life. First off, the venue was 5 minutes from the strip so all of my friends that came from out of town stayed on the strip and had a quick cab ride over. They let me transform the entire space with pipe and drape, a flower wall, and an awesome sound system.The rigging points made it easy for the Cirque performer to spin, the champagne girl to be suspended and pouring bubbly for the guests. I was able to bring in my own vendors: catering ( Wolfgang Puck ) florals (Miss Daisy) and event management company (Best Agency). Everyone was fantastic and easy to work with. The parking lot was large and safe enough for all 150 guests to park their cars with valet or self park. I would recommend this venue for anyone looking for a large blank space to create any type of event, with decor it adds richness to the space, without it you have this awesome urban warehouse vibe that is hard to find in Las Vegas. I can't wait for my next event at The Industrial!",pos

"So i was released from hospital with a life vest ( defibrillator) diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  I called to make an appointment with TRi city instead of going with hospital referred doctors.  Big huge mistake.  When i get there i check in which was hard cause by the time i walked down the hall through garage i was light headed.  Receptionist knew this,  yet nobody paid any real concern.  They call me to go in back to see doctor.  The girl that took me back looked and acted like she hated her job ( BIG TIME).  I walk in small little room start asking me questions.  I asked if they got medical records from hospital.  She says no!!  i couldnt believe it.  I signed a release for them to get the records..  Finally they find them which tells me doctor didnt pay any attention to a guy coming to see him wearing a life vest.  Doctor didnt have a clue of what was going on with me.  Actually he asked me how im recovering from GALLBLADDER being removed.  WTF is he talking about...  Then tells me I dont need my life vest and to take it off...  WTF!!! Then wanted to take me off heart medication to help my heart saying i Dont need it.  So im on lasik medication yet he wouldnt prescribe Potassium pills to help with crapping.  Somthing you should really be on when on Lasik .  I could go on and on about how stupid this guy is or Should I say Clueless.  He didnt give a shit....  he just wanted to get me out of there.  Then he Tells me to go to check out.  Okay,  i put my vest back on as he said i guarantee i wont need it..  Talk about arrogant!  
         So now i'm at check out.  Some guy with shoulder length hair walks into the girls area.  He says who keeps scheduling DR. STERN he will refuse any more patience.  Stop scheduling him he will refuse all new patience.  This guy  just went on and on right in front of me.  Im thinking that is messed up to say infront of  one of his new Patience..  Well at least that explains why he could of gave a shit less about me. He was just pushing me out cause he didnt even want me as a patient.  Which was obvious after things the Doctor said..  
1. Nobody knew i was on life vest!!!! pretty hard not to see.
2. My Gallbladder taken out.  Hey buddy get better glasses... far from it...
3. Taking me off Heart medication C.H.F...  very stupid..
4. Telling me to take my life vest off and saying I dont need it.  IDIOT i almost died..
5. DR. STERN dont want more patience..  Thanks for making me feel like shit...

They don't pay attention to orders, have zero customer service skills, and management clearly doesn't care, as they only have 17 reviews and 98% of them are bad.

"I found Auprés de Ma Blonde while looking for a place to hang out and have a drink while waiting for a reservation at a ""big F'ing deal"" place nearby. My coworker and I just wanted to have a drink but the smell of the food (mussels) coming out prompted me to ask my coworker if we should eat here instead. He replied that I'd made such a big F'ing deal about the ""big F'ing deal"" place that we had to go there. The other place disappointed us both and Auprés de Ma Blonde didn't when I stopped in on my next trip to Montreal. The mussels and fries are awesome. The steaks have been really good too. One of the low reviews criticizes the fish n chips. Seriously, you ordered the fish n F'ing chips at a bistro in Montreal?!  I bet he orders the burger when he goes to Katz's. If the place is busy then the wait service suffers a bit but no big deal. Order a Belle Geuele or a Cheval Blanc and some mussels and enjoy!",pos

He also let me try the sauces before committing to them. Poke itself is okay, I think it's a little too much sushi for me, but the fact that the person helping me was so patient and explained the process to me is the reason I'm giving this place five stars! If I was into a whole lot of fish I would have also given this place five stars because it was actually pretty good! It's basically sushi in a bowl.

"My husband booked a weekend at the Mirage this past June for my birthday weekend. We will never stay at the Mirage again. Walking in to the lobby for check in, the hotel looks very nice. However when we got inside of the room it was a completely different story. It looked like our room had not been touched in months. There were crumbs on the floor and thick patches of dust around the mini fridge and bed frame. My husband went downstairs to report it and we were moved to a different room. To my disbelief the second room was no better than the first. Only difference was there were no crumbs this time. 
I refuse to sleep in filth, especially when we are paying $200 a night. My husband went downstairs yet again. This time I went with him. My husband asked if would be possible to have a manager accompany us to see the filth for themselves.The smug front desk rep with a not so friendly attitude said that wouldn't be possible. I explained to him that my husband is an AGM for a major hotel franchise. This is something that would usually take place if a customer has complained about multiple rooms. He than explained to me that the Mirage is SO large of a hotel that no manager would do such a thing. He proceeded to rush us into another room. 
Room number 3 was just as dusty as the first 2 rooms. And there was a random hair on our sheets. We would have moved hotels, but it was hard to find a room at decent rate short notice. At this point my husband and I were tired from traveling and had no more energy to waste. For the duration of our time at the Mirage, I walked around with shoes on. Never setting foot an the carpet. And I slept on top of the fitted sheet, but I could not sleep under the dingy blanket. Lucky we were able to spend most of our weekend out of the room. The bathroom I must say was pretty decent compared to the rest of the room. Which is the only reason I'm giving one start. I've stayed in some very nice hotels. I expected the same quality from the Mirage. But instead received motel quality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",neg

"I spent a few weeks in Edinburgh at a friends house. I loved this whole experience, though I am not much of a big city person. So to find out that they lived a few blocks from the Pentlands was a blessing in my eyes. I started my trek through the Flotterstone Information Center. I grabbed a map, some water, food, and a fully charged camera. I didn't have much of a plan other than summiting the highest peak. As with many of my solo adventures, I didn't bother to look at the map, I found a trial looked for the tallest peak I could see and started walking towards it. I highly recommend not doing this as it's a good way to get lost. The first peak I hiked up to was Turnhouse Hill, at first glimpse it appears that Caplaw or Turnhouse Hill are the tallest peaks, but they are not. You really need to look at the map to find the tallest peak. Once I made it past a few false summits, I could see the next peak, Carnethy Hill. Once again I was sure that Canethy would be the tallest hill, but once I reached the top I could see Scald Law, this was the actual tallest peak. From here I had a snack and decided to actually look at the map. I walked down to the bottom and followed the Road by the lakes to make my way over to Capelaw Hill. The lakes were gorgeous and filled with fly fisherman. I have no clue what they were fishing for other than trout. But many of them seemed to be having luck. Many of the peaks here had older cairns at the top. It would be a good idea to check out the website for this area and come prepared for wet uphill hiking. Here is a link to the land management agency that maintains this area. If you love nature, try to plan a good half day for this park so you don't have to miss out on too much.

My bf & I have been on the hunt for vegan friendly pizza places whenever we're craving some pizza. We tried Pieology but weren't satisfied and luckily I ran upon all the reviews saying that this place had vegan toppings including cheese and meats (chicken and sausage) which was a deal breaker! 

It's only $7.99 for a 12 inch pizza and you get the choice of unlimited toppings. For just $2 extra, the vegan toppings are automatically added to your pizza - such a great deal! We covered it with a bunch of veggies and the pizza was absolutely delicious! 

The sauces (except alfredo and the pestos) are all vegan as well as their choice of crusts (Traditional, Wheat, and Gluten Free). 

There's also plenty of seating in the restaurant and love how it has a ""homey kitchen"" vibe ambiance, just as the name entails. 

We were super happy and will definitely be back soon whenever we need a pizza fix!",pos
"If I was only rating the food, it would be 5 stars. Everything tasted fresh and yummy. 

The restaurant itself, however, is very dirty. From the bathrooms to the menus, there is a layer of grease/filth on everything. Before the food came out, I made a point to wash my hands again and not touch the menu, the seats or the table so I don't get it on my hands. 

The service was mediocre at best. Our server constantly leaned over our food and table and we even had to send back a bowl of rice because his dirty shirt went in it. When we asked for anything extra, it seemed like we were an inconvenience and the server wouldn't even answer. 

Maybe it's just me, but when I see a place this dirty, I don't want to come back. It just makes me picture how nasty the kitchen must be. 

I will definitely not be back.",pos
"Perhaps the most disappointing consumer experience of my life. If I could leave a zero, I would. So much for the customer being right. Clearly, Jesse could not care less about me as a new customer that could have spent quite a sum of money in their store.

As a beginner player, I picked up a used racket on Saturday for my first lesson on Monday. At that point, Pam was great and made a few recommendations and I chose a racket to start. After a dozen balls on Monday evening, the instructor recommended that I move to a lighter racket. The instructor actually goes to the store on Tuesday afternoon and locates a lighter racket that may work. I speak with the instructor on the way to the store and we determine perhaps a better investment at this time may be a good quality pair of shoes and that we revisit the racquet purchase in a couple of weeks. 

I didn't think asking for a store credit in the amount equal to the amount paid for the racket would be an issue. I couldn't have been more wrong! When I arrived at the store, I introduced myself to Jesse and shook his hand. I explained that I would prefer to return the racket for a store credit towards shoes. He said that my instructor picked out a racket and he was not interested in giving me a store credit towards new shoes. His attitude towards me was quite angry.

After another failed attempt to get him to provide a credit towards new shoes I replied, OK, I will take the replacement racket and buy my shoes elsewhere. He then responded by putting the returned racket back up on the counter and saying how 'bout I do this? In other words, take the old racket back. I once again confirmed that he was not willing to provide a credit towards new shoes and his demeanor got much worse. It was at that point I said do the exchange for the replacement racket and I will be on my way. All of this with other patrons in the store hearing and observing the exchange.

To think I could have such a positive experience on Saturday with Pam who helped in every way possible and turn around a few days later and have this experience with Jesse basically supports every negative story about this store that I have heard from other tennis players in the area. I thought I would give them a try and make my own assessment. 

In closing, this store no longer exists in my mind. For Jesse to respond in such a juvenile and unprofessional manner was completely out of line. 

I will never recommend this store to anyone!",neg
"Tasty, but too expensive. 

The girl who took my order was really nice and poured me a glass water even though I was taking out. I would say great service, but the time it actually took to make the sundae was surprising (more on this).

I ordered The Sumner Night. I love mango and have tried various Asian mango frozen treats along Yonge. As I got my order I was shocked at the size o.o when she handed it to me. It took all that time for this? It was meager in proportion and offensive! I payed $9.05 for a cup of mango ice cream, mango bits and cornflakes (on the bottom and got very soggy). If you want to compare, think of grande sized cup from Starbucks and then to add further insult do not fill it to the top of the cup. It was basically one scoop of ice cream with other bits in a cup!!! 

There are a ton off other offerings with way way way way way better value. I thought Sweet O clock was a bit pricey, but you get way more for the same price and better quality.

"I can't get enough of this place! You may take a look at the menu and think that it's a tad pricey as I did, but don't be fooled - you get A LOT of deep fried porky goodness for what you pay! I've tried almost all of their sauces, and I'm torn between the original... and everything else. The best way to go about it is to go with a bunch of other (non germaphobic) people and just dip your pork into their plates. I recommend the pork tender, but several of my friends can't tell the different between the loin (cheapest and bigger) and the tender. I've also tried some of their appetizers, which are good but I don't remember what they were because THE KATSU. BASICALLY WHAT I AM SAYING IS if you like katsu please come here and get almost anything and you will be happy. Unless you're from Japan, in which case you'll at least be content. Kthxbye.",pos
"I've been here several times.  The food is always spot on.  Tonite I had a problem with our waitress Gabrielle.  We were a table of 50 something ladies - I can vouch for all the ladies seated we are generous tippers when it comes to great service.  This evening's service was very sub standard.  I'm hoping she was a waitress-in-training.  We had to go to the bar to ask for mayonnaise for a sandwich, a fresh cup of coffee, refill on bar drinks and never checked back after being served in a timely manner.  However, she did have time to chat with a neighboring table of 20-somethings and dote on their needs.  Step up to the plate young adults under 30 that wait on tables.....you would have made $30 on our table but instead chose to take home only $5 because of poor service.",neu

"I first used Hannah for my toddler when he was around 18m and we were having trouble going from two naps to one. She easily fixed our problem with a few minor tweaks. Then I had my second child who in my mind was the worst sleeper ever. He would wake up multiple times during nap, multiple times at night, and I would have to rock him for an hour to even get him to sleep in the first place. I knew sleep training was hard though and I kept making up excuses on why I didn't want to do it yet. Come seven months later and I was going crazy with a kid who never slept and was always overtired. So I enlisted the help oh Hannah once again. She ensured me that we would have him sleeping in no time and I almost didn't believe her... I mean I can't get him to sleep in under an hour there was no way he was going to sleep on his own. I defiantly had my doubts and if it did work I figured I would be spending my nights listening to him cry and I would probably be crying too. I remember a few days before we started I went and read all Hannah's reviews because surely none of the kids she helped were as bad as mine. Wrong! I loved reading all the success stories and picked a date. The first night he cried 20min, the next nap 9 min and pretty much from then on he was falling asleep completely on his own with no crying. I was shocked!!!!!! In less than 24hrs my horrible sleeper was falling asleep on his own and staying asleep. I'm still in shock. I paid for the week of texting which was amazing, anytime I had an inclining of doubt in the program Hannah was there to encourage me. Within one week my horrible sleeper was sleeping 12hrs at night and napping 3-4hrs during the day. I finally can take a shower in the morning, I started eating breakfast again, and I even get to talk to my hubby at night!  I still can't believe it, and I REALLY wish I did it sooner. My entire family is happier now that we all get our rest. Hannah is so amazing- I just can't say enough about her program and most importantly that it actually works.",pos

"We were there to see a performance of  Vegas, The Show. The performance was old school Vegas entertainment and I recommend you take it in. It evokes the great acts from the 40's to the 90's. This is an ensemble performance with a dozen or so terrific performers in the ensemble and a first class orchestra. 

I do not think there are any bad seats in the house so you do not need the more expensive tickets. You can buy a dinner/performance package but that will not likely actually save you any money. 

The theater has comfortable seats, good sound and all the seats seem to have a great view. There is a bar in the waiting lounge and bar service in the theater before the performance starts. 

The staff were helpful when asked for help. 

The lounge area and bar are dark and  on the edge of shabby. They need work and pulled down our expectations for the performance.",neu
"Good ramen, great (and adorable!!) atmosphere. This ramen place is in an old house with inside seating, and a lovely outdoor patio. Unfortunately I don't have a photo of the bowl of ramen as it was too dark, but I was happy with it. I had the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly - the broth was thick and flavorful, noodles were good, the egg was prepared and seasoned well. The seaweed appetizer was surprisingly good and unusual with the addition of tasty shiitake mushrooms. One thing that I didn't really enjoy was the spring roll appetizer which was rather bland.",pos
"This is a great find for a city this size and its relatively new which is always a plus. The attached parking garage that leads directly to your room floor is very handy and secured with key cards and worth $9 a day without a doubt.

Are you going to have a Zen moment here...probably not given its a limited service hotel...but what more can you expect at this rate. What you get is a comfortable convienent effecient place in a nice neighborhood with lots of dining choices just around the corner.

Had to laugh when reading a few reviews...""the maid barely knocked then barged in and almost saw me naked"" ... too funny...ever heard of locking your door like when you are at home to keep strangers out? Or ""the hotel employee guy in the breakfast area nearly talked my leg off and I couldnt get rid of him""...how about just telling him you are trying to concentrate on figuring out where you are going to fill your pie hole next later that day...that ought to work. How about taking some personal responsibility for your life rather than blaming everyone else for your issues...really. This is a great place and CU is lucky to have it...plain and simple.

I checked the reviews of the brand of windows they represented and found them to be rated in the upper quartile and the bid was very competitively priced.

"4 stars for Mariko and the concept...but honestly I woulda given this one more around 3.5 stars.... I knowwww!?! but I was spoiled rotten and the bar was just too high for Sports de Combat to quite reach. That being said, i still had a lot of fun and so did my +1 and I would consider coming back ... 

Things that were awesome: So many activities all under one roof! Easy to find building, decent location and size. Freezies on site. Yah that rawked! I loved getting a bullseye with a bow and real arrow!! I loved hanging out with my fellow Yelpers and meeting their guests!

Things that kinda irked me: 

Poorly organized by the place's staff...one guy kinda took the lead and explained the activities and how to go about participating, but he did so with his back to half the crowd so most of us were clueless as to where to go and ended up missing chances to participate in certain things. Each staff was clearly identified to which activity they would oversee tho and they each did a good job of explaining the activity...but they seemed like they were winging the organization of it all quite a bit. 

The Rage room was reserved for the winner of the contests at the bow n arrow and axe throwing activities: which was not me, so I didn't get to smash stuff booooo. 

We never saw the Puzzle room? Or at least I didn't. 

The axes weren't fabu (dull, small n weird lookin), but it was fun throwing them, despite not a single one sticking into the wood (almost got one but it fell out a second later).

Their version of dodgebow (""archery combat"" as it's called here) was small, cramped, took wayyyy too long to explain (especially for those of us who went to Dodgebow) and was wayyy too short, also their helmets are suffocating and the ""field"" is very cramped and tiny. 

And .. I didn't get to nerf battle. (Aforementioned organization issue). I was lookin forward to that. 

So yah great potential...love that there was all that under one roof. The staff are super sweet and friendly. They have a buncha awesome stuff to smash if u do try the Rage room. 

And otherwise all 4 stars go to Mariko and Yelp for getting us this kool opportunity and Mariko again for bringing us pizza and cheese !!!! Such a great snack with such great ppl! Thanks againnnnnnn!!!!!!",neu
"Great place!  I visited thevCrown and Dragon for the first time last Sunday, after having the place highly recommended to me by friends.  They were so right!  This pub is nice and casual, with a friendly vibe.  My friends and I enjoyed sitting on the patio, and we made great use of the Sunday half price wing deal.  We ended up having 8 lbs of wings, which definitely took care of our hunger pangs, and at a GREAT price.  We chose both the Original Buffalo and Dragon's Breath sauces, and liked both.  The Dragon's Breath is definitely hotter/spicier, but both were enjoyably hot without being overwhelming.

Special shout out to our server!  She was great!  Very attentive, and seemed to actually anticipate when we needed something, and was right on it.

Had a great experience, and will definitely be back soon!",pos
My fiance and I ordered cheesecake factory through door dash. I ordered the Evelyns favorite pasta. When I went in for my second bite I noticed a long black hair in my food. So disgusting. I called cheesecake factory to let them know and they said they couldn't do anything for me because I ordered through door dash. A hair in my food is not a result of door dash. It's a result of improper hygiene in their kitchen. I will not be ordering cheesecake factory again after the experience I had. Terrible customer service.,neg

"LOVE XOXO LOVE MJT!!

It's probably the closest thing to Seattle's Pike Place Market less fish.   This is used by mostly locals and few tourists.  

Next time I will stay nearby and start my trip  here.  I'll spend a whole day eating through and getting snacks for rest of my trip here!   

MJT  is located in Little Italy, originally settled by northern Italians and is a large produce/farmers market.  Around the perimeter, there are bakeries, charcuteries, kitchen gadgets, caffe, ethnic grocers etc.  Within the market itself there is a small food court too with créperie, Indian foods, sausage/burger stand, desserts etc., but more than 70% are producers selling their goods everything from eggs, mushrooms, cheeses, jam, spices, fruits, flowers to meats.  There was one oyster bar that had at least 2 dozen different varieties (Next time - it was a little early in the day for a raw bar).  

++. Ambiance is easy outdoor strolling through an old fashioned market.  In winter, it's smaller and is enclosed.

+++ Products were fabulous!  Did you see all my pics of gorgeous veggies? They focus on local Quebec, not organics.  Lots of maple syrups and butters and cheese curds.    

+.  Service is mostly good.  This is not geared to tourists so keep in mind when you are shopping that they are going to focus on locals who buy here than at grocery stores.  

+.  Prices were cheaper than at Molina, a nearby Italian grocer on produces but not on cheese and meats.  Most take credit cards and cash is welcomed.

"I hate to do this because the people there were very nice. However! Last night was the first time going to Pizza Heaven. I have heard good things about it so I figured I would give it a try. I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and 10 hot wings to go. When I got to my car I took a couple bites of the pizza and was pretty disappointed. It had very little flavor, and the crust was to crispy with very little flavor. 
    After I got home I ate a couple more slices and ended up throwing the rest away. I then tried the wings. Disappointed again!! Extremely strong pepper flavor and very little sauce. It tasted like pepper flavored backed chicken.

"I wish I would have read some of the other reviews before trying to engage this outfit to consider buying my furniture.  I would give this no stars if that was an option.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this company.  Not only is the individual who is responsible for reviewing the furniture rude, he does not follow through.  I spent a good week sending multiple emails with pics attached and trying to follow up to get a status, only to be told the emails were never received, (I received a confirm # each time I sent), and then, finally, when he did respond, he was rude and brusk and advised he would need to come out and review the furniture before he could offer a bid.   he set the time w a 3 hour window and then, he did not show up on the time he had scheduled to come to my home.   no call, no text ... he just blew me off.

We ordered a snickers flap jack, and this thing was the size of a pizza. I thought the waitress was joking when she said it was the size of a Prius tire, but she wasn't. HUGE, and more surprising, no loss of flavor or quality. Great exterior with a nice, soft interior. 

I had some bacon and eggs, and they were as good as any I've ever had. Our friends ordered the house special (I forget the name) but it had a sage fried chicken, waffle, some crazy good sauce, mashed potatoes, and fried spaghetti.

I am seated and the waiter was nice. I ordered a bottle of sparkling water but he really pushed me to buy alcohol. I said no but it was awkward. I got their salad special of the night which was a shaved fennel, beet, and grapefruit salad. It was quite refreshing and delicious.

Then I got the caprese pizza. For 18 dollars, I thought it was overpriced for what you got. Now I tend to eat a lot and I ate it all. So for two people, you might need 2 pizzas if you don't eat anything else.

We ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The fried rice was not as good as I was expecting. The rice was kind of hard and it just tasted like vinegar. The ""adobo"" flavor that I was looking for was close to non-existent. It came with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry. At least the serving size was enough for at least two people. I also tried their red velvet pancakes. I thought it was okay as it was missing that kick of red velvet (if you had your eyes closed while eating, you'd probably think it was just a regular pancake."" I understand that the restaurant is not that spacious but the tables are way too close to each other. I definitely came to this place with a really high expectation and I just let myself down. At least our server was pretty attentive to our needs.",pos
Very good food and fast. Friendly staff. Great location with lots of pre/post dinner options.,pos
"This is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. Literally, from the moment I arrived, it started to go down hill. And, just. Kept. Snowballing.

I was meeting friends for dinner at 630p for their promo of bottomless street tacos and margaritas for $25. I was a bit early, so I went to the bar for a drink. I explained to the bartender that I was meeting friends, but I was early. I ordered a Sangria. And, when she served it to me I tried to give her my card because I knew my dining companions were on their way, I knew I wouldn't be drinking a 2nd drink at the bar, and I knew it would slow things down to have to pay my bar tab when it was time to be seated. She refused and told me she'd start a tab. I said I didn't want to do that and again tried to hand her my card, but she told me it was no problem and walked away. But, it actually was a problem for me. When my friends arrived, I again tried to pay for my drink and after about 3 minutes of waiting at the bar and being unsuccessful, I gave up and joined my friends at our table. I mentioned my unpaid for drink to the hostess and our server. So, I made a strong effort to tell several employees.

We asked to be seated on the patio since it was a nice night. I initially thought it was closed since no one was sitting out there, but they told us it wasn't when we asked. And, after we were seated out there, other Diners followed suit. But, even this felt like it took time.

Once we were seated, we were given menus, and then we waited...and waited...and waited. It took FOREVER to get someone to come take our order. When the server finally did take our orders (there 6 of us). He then started retaking our orders. It was odd, but we laughed it off. We, also, asked to see a dessert menu at this time, which never came.

4 of the 6 ordered the bottomless special, and 2 of us ordered other items off the menu. The people who ordered the bottomless tacos tried to order what they felt like they wanted to start, for example 3 of each kind, but we're told they could only have 5 at a time. I get it, you don't want to leave the kitchen scrambling, but c'mon. AND...it made no difference since 2 of the 4 taco eaters were left with no food for at least 30 minutes. At no time did a manager or a server, or anyone else come by to apologise for or explain the delay. It turned out that those 2 diners had ordered al pastor tacos and the kitchen had run out and were making more. So you say nothing?? And, let half a party eat and half a party eat nothing?? Really??

I had ordered nachos which I 100% didn't eat. I didn't eat them because I had nothing to drink for at least 45 minutes to an hour. Nothing. I had ordered a 2nd Sangria and it just never came...partly because our server disappeared partly because when he did he told us they had sent people home and they were slammed. In the meantime, someone at our table who had not ordered a 2nd drink because they still had half of their 1st one, was given a 2nd drink...while I had nothing. Even my water glass was long empty by this time. Again, no one cared to ask if something was wrong with the nachos or inquire as to why they were sitting in front of me completely untouched.

In addition to the dessert menu that never came, was an order of chips and guacamole. No one ever offered dessert either. They did, however charge us for the chips & guacamole we never got. The server removed them from the bill, but questioned that we didn't get them. WHO did he think brought them?? Certainly not him. He was nowhere to be found!!

I feel bad blaming the server. I know that they're the face you see and when things are going wrong elsewhere in a restaurant, they get blamed. Clearly, there were failures all over this restaurant. The management should not have sent anyone home leaving the place short staffed, the kitchen wasn't prepared for week 2 of the bottomless taco promo, and if you are serving a bar full of people and running a bottomless margarita promo you need more than 1 bartender. I dine out often enough to understand this and none of us gave the server any flack. But, WHERE was anyone... our server, ANY server, A MANAGER to explain the unbelievably long delays and just say they were sorry for it. Our bill was over $150 for the 6 of us. There had to be someone available to say or do something to make up for it...yet no one came. And, that is why I won't be heading back to Casa del Matador. The food was OK, but the service/execution was horrendous.",neg
"Very good. Complex flavours. Not too pricey for the amount that you get. The most redeeming qualities about this place are: the conviviality of the owner/employees, the consistency in quality of the dish as you devour (doesn't get dry or bland), and how healthy and guilt-free you feel after the meal. My only issue with this place is that I may or may not have gotten mild food poisoning. It may have just been something else I ate, considering the friends I went with were fine. Overall, a cute spot.",pos
I love Panda Express so I came to this one. I stood in line and there was one lady working that I could see. I was behind the person ordering their food. Then a man walks up to the glass in front of the food basically cutting me in line. The worker woman had looked at me multiple times already and knew my place in line but she served this random dude who just showed up. I had already been standing in line for a while at this point. I looked at both of them in amazement and the lady didn't even acknowledge me. So I walked away in frustration. Never coming here again.,neg
This is for the Subway at the Monte Carlo. 10.50 got a foot long BMT? You have to be kidding. Can't even get a glass of water. Terrible service and the bread tastes old. You guys should at least wear masks and carry guns if you're going to rob people.,neg

"We had our first appoint not too long ago but I really loved how comfortable they made my 7 year old feel, she was pretty nervous! The office was fun and all the employees were super fun and sweet. Dr. Webster made the assessment and decided to put a space maintainer in her mouth for now and come back in a few months. I was thankful that they didn't just try to throw braces in there and go crazy when she wasn't ready. Very honest and open consultation and we are happy to say this will be our orthodontic home!

"Although i have passed from this street several times, i haven't noticed this restaurant before, found it when i was looking for my MealPal lunch. It is decorated very nicely, best decorated Vietnamese restaurant i have ever seen, very cozy. Service was very fast and kind. I had beef pho, it was very yummy!!!

It was take out, they put noodles and cooked beef in one container, veggies in a bag(lime slices, greens, sprouts), beef broth and sauce. There were 2 types short sprouts, they were crunchy an: delicious. In a separate bag there was some red meat, i was almost gonna cook it in microwave, but magically as soon as i put beef broth on it it turned cooked!!! mixed everything and ate the whole thing, it was such a treat!!!",pos
"The pizza was excellent, loved the flaky crust.
The staff was beyond friendly and on it with the refills. 
The dining room (or patio?) is what makes this place confusing and uncomfortable. It's Nevada in the summer. Days are 110+, it's sunny, it's hot. Why the hell would you put an open air dining room in Nevada? It's hot, it's uncomfortable, it's tiny, everyone's smashed in, and you have to wait 45 minutes for your pizza. Why? Oh but there is Mister's. MASSIVE out put misters. When inside it's like a fog, dense wet air. They do the job of cooling you down, but personally I don't like being sprayed with the garden hose while waiting for my $30 pizza.",pos
"Horrible salon. Overpriced prices, rude staff, tacky decorations, and just a bad overall feel. I hate how they mix the boutique in with the salon. The chair I had my hair done in had tacky purses hanging on them. Can I say unprofessional?! I came the first time and went to Chad and he was nothing but wonderful! Then I came back again and went to another stylist (since Chad was booked) but she acted like she was better than everyone and gave me striped (unwanted) highlights at the cost of $300. I explained I didn't like the way she did them and she replied ""I don't have time, I can have you come back in but I'll have to charge you."" Worst experience ever! I have nothing but horrible things to say about this trashy and overpriced place!!! Also it's dusty and I saw about 3 bugs while in the salon. Never going back again and I tell everyone how this is the worst salon I've ever been to! If I could give this a negative star I would!",neg

"I've eaten here twice now courtesy of my dad.  I live in LA and we have lots of great Chinese food available to us, so our standards are a bit higher than most.  From the sound of the name,  you wouldn't think much of Asian Cafe Express.  However, they do a very nice job of putting out some authentic Cantonese food.  The taste and flavors of their dishes are not exactly what we have come to like, but everyplace has there variances according to the cook.  Still, both times we have come with 6 or 7 seven people and have ordered enough food for double that.  Both times, the food was very consistent and I have no complaints about anything.  The girls there work hard and are pretty quick considering only 2 of them handle the whole restaurant.  Prices here are very reasonable, even for Chinese food.",pos

I have been here at least 3 times in last 6 months and have always enjoyed the food. The service is unparalleled and the carefully selected menu makes it easy. The dessert options are the best ..i almost come here to savor them..but today (07/25/17) its been a disaster ..the AC wasn't running and the food took forever.. By the way it was 90F outside.. Im sure u didnt learn tat ur AC wasn't working minutes before u started seating people. U barely had enough fans to place it around for ventilation.. worst case u had outdoor seating tat wasn't baking at 110F ..but u had no outdoor service ..i had to run out of the restaurant without enjoying my desserts becoz i was worried that  by the time it reaches the table it wuld melted away.. and my colleagues where kinda a running out of breath ..there is no excuse to wat happened today considering the price we pay ..u shuld have handled this better .. hope u wuld for the sake of the food u guys serve..,pos

"Payed way more than the job was worth. The guy who did my nails was rude, rushed and insulting. They didn't look very good so I decided to get them removed less than a week later and the process was so painful. I've had acrylics removed 2 days later and it was nothing close to this pain. The skin under my nails was bruised and sore for over a week. My cousin got hers done the same day with a lady and she was getting a manicure & nails painted. Her nails were cut even though she asked to file and try to Keep as much length. Besides her fingers being mangled she returned the next day because the nail polish started to chip. Rather drive the additional 20 minutes to the old salon I went to before trying this closer one ever again.",neg

"Everything about this place leaves a lot to be desired.

Cheese options on the salad bar were cubes of cheddar or pepper jack. The rest of the salad bar was equally disappointing. 

The Feijouda was black beans in extra water. Zero seasoning or meat was evident. They also did not have any faroafa to accompany the Feijouda.

The caprinias were meh and the meat was surprisingly bad. Poor cuts of meat with little care given to their preparation. The selection was also meager as I only saw tri tip, sirloin, lamb and chicken wings. 

Service was relatively poor, I was able to run out of meat several times. The frequency or the servers circulating was spotty at best, and they tended to skip tables. 

Even with coupons or Groupon discounts, this place is not worth it.",neg

Drinks were flowing and the crowd was happy and well served with the influx of the small business networking crowd. The wait wasn't long for drinks or food. 

I tried one each of the carnitas, barbacoa and chicken taco. Loved the pickled onions and the guac on the side. The guac had big chunks of avocado and tons of flavor. Spicy! 

Big kudos to the bartender, Elizabeth, and the manager, Fabian. They were on point and really went the extra mile to serve. Gracias!",pos

"First of all the food is always excellent and a good value for the amount of food you get. But my visit today july 25 was a disappointment,  not for the food , but the service,  and my waitress peggy. We was seated my two young boys and i, in the old part of the diner.  Took forever to get waited on, drinks included.  Peggy finely took our order. 3 hoagies, one steak ,two Italian.  The steak hoagie came first,  we noticed no ranch dressing according to what was on the menu, after waiting forever for peggy to come back. We mentioned no ranch dressing,  she acted surprised,  and sounded like it was a burden to get him the ranch dressing.  She brought it, finally. 15 minutes later the rest of our food came out . I instructed my son to wait until all the food showed up.the food was delicious, as usual  but other customers were asking were the waitress peggy was. I asked for the bill, peggy gave it to me, went to the register. I was told only peggy could ring me up. 10 minutes later no peggy,  I said I needed to pay the bill now, I had my teenage boys waiting in the car. Was it Peggy s first day on the job? I noticed all the other waitresses was fast and efficient.  My low tip reflected my disappointment on the poor service,  not the food..",neg

"Worst car wash ever....scammers too. I drive up and they notice i have veteran licence plates. The glass repair employee will not take no for an answer. Im already struggling taking 3 toddlers and a stroller out of my van i eventually tell him yes but I'd like to speak to my insurance first. I walk in with my ticket to pay and i go ahead and tell the cashier to tell the man I'm not interested. She goes to tell him and he walks in to yell at me that he already completed the job. Um, i told you i wanted to talk to my insurance first....he was literally harassing me about this. 

Second, way overpriced for the quality of wash you get. I have a van and understand larger cars are extra. I don't mind paying the $$ for a quality job. But everytime they get done with my van i have to wipe my car down more, vacuum more or point out places they missed. Then they get pissed at me.

Any seat in this place has a great view and the stage is so big that you're not missing any breath taking scenes.  The mixture of these majestic horses, acrobats, music and singers was Perfect Harmony!!! It was definitely a great experience to go there with my family and my kids really enjoyed it.  The show runs for 1 hour 30 min intermission and then another hour to top it off.  
One thing to know if you go there no taking photos i seen a lot of get in trounle with the ushers when taking photos.  Undeestandable they want the random flash photography distract a horse but ppl are more courtesy to take photos with flash but even that usnt allowed.  They have spotters on top amd they will catch you.  I feel it should be a good thing for ppl to take photo's.  These photos will be shared in the social media and this will gain more positive exposure for the company which will increase tickets sales.
One thing to know is that they charge $15 prepaid parking or pay there at $25 parking.  Its a load of crock i live in Mississauga and the Hershey center has more then enough free parking to accomodate patrons. Dont get scared by the tow your car signs made by the establishment they dont jave the ability ti ticket nor tow your vechicle.

Is the $140 ticket justified.  Yes given this is a a huge production and entry fee has to cover all these expenses.

Just went there early this week. They have a very poor selection. My eldest (3) was looking at and touching the candies that they put RIGHT at child's eye level and reach. I was in the process of getting her to put them back. An employee came and hovered over us. It was rude. Why do you put candy - an obvious temptation for a child - right in their reach? Illogical. And they put these notices around the candy that sampling is forbidden and that you will be prosecuted if you're caught sampling. A piece of advice - MOVE THE CANDY OUT OF CHILD'S REACH! COMMON SENSE! Then I asked about the pita bread. They told me that it's fresh when it obviously was not. They bring it in from California frozen. That's not fresh. Poor meat selection. Won't go back again.,neg
Excellent service from Greg and his team. Highly recommended.,pos

Ordered via phone, order repeated to me via same phone call. Paid via credit card over phone. 
Picked up pizzas, service great in-store. 

Got home, there is pepperoni/ham meat item all over one of the pizzas. The entire thing. 
As a strict vegetarian, this was not ok. 

Called the store, they told me I could come back for a new one. I said No, I would like a refund. My children are getting ready for bed and I don't have more time tonight. I asked for a refund again, to which I was told no again. He said I could come back next time for a pizza on them. I said I wouldn't be coming back after being denied twice for a refund. He asked a manager who said no refunds given. Really? 

I'm a vegetarian who just paid for a pizza my family cannot eat, and it's in the garbage. 

Giving no refunds for guest issues is terrible business practice, and I won't be supporting a company that doesn't take care of their guests for situations like this. Totally turned off.",neg

It smelled like an old run down bar. It was incredibly unappetizing but still since I had ordered it to go I figured the actual meal might be worth it. Not exactly. To start, all the add ins (sprouts, jalapeños, limes) were all old and dusky. The chicken smelled and tasted sour so I didn't add it into my Pho. The noodles were about the only appetizing thing and the broth was ok, but nothing I would go back again for.",neg

"The food was good, however, the service was horrid. Seriously, I've received better service from diners. The waiter, while not overtly rude, was not particularly friendly. We asked him how many tapas we should order for three people. He recommended 7-10. We weren't too hungry, so we ordered 5, and only one alcoholic beverage. He wasn't happy. He said, ""Well, that's a start,"" and left us with a menu in case we needed to order anything else, which we would have if he had come back to our table to acknowledge our presence. Not once while we were eating did he come back to check how we were doing, if the food was okay, if we wanted more drinks, or if we wanted to order more food - which we did. He didn't even remove the dirty plates. I understand that he wasn't going to make a large tip off of our table, but this service and his attitude were really beyond the pale. We were going to order dessert, but my nephew, who wanted to leave a $1 tip, didn't feel like we should spend any more money after being treated so rudely. I normally tip 18-25%.

"Fabulous office. I have been having weird issues with my insurance company, resulting in me not having been to the dentist for a full year and now I've got several issues with my teeth. Dr. Hansen (he told me to call him Richard, what a cool guy) was the most friendly, helpful dentist I have EVER been to. I'm pretty young and have found that a lot of doctors can be very patronizing to younger patients, but not with Dr. Hansen or any of the employees I spoke to. They are, however, VERY informative and answered every question I had under the sun.

I had to drive 50 minutes to get there (I live in NC) because they're the closest provider that takes my insurance, but even when I get new insurance and can go to someone closer I will still return to this office.

Karen, Rose, and the front office guy (his name escapes me!) are the bomb, super organized AND they sorted out everything with my insurance even though there were some technical difficulties. Tiffany (she took my x-rays and did my cleaning) was incredibly knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor.

I read some negative reviews from a few years ago and got nervous before I went in, but I think that they've gotten new staff or those reviews weren't legit, because I can't believe that was the same office. I wish I could give them more than five stars, I am more than satisfied with this office and excited to have found a dentist that I don't mind going to (even if the drive sucks)!",pos
"In my lengthy and desperate search for back pain relief I found massage envy.  As far as the establishment itself goes it's the easily the most professional and relaxing massage spa I found in Vegas.  I was searching for a therapist that could relieve me of my chronic back pain (lower and mid) I've suffering from for 2 years now.  Tommie was and has been my therapist ever since I walked into her room and she said I'd notice relief after the second session and have my life back after a couple more.  She kept her word and I am back to my normal everyday activities light and strenuous.  The pain was bad enough at one point I wasn't able to walk.  If you have back pain I'd highly recommend Tommie, incredibly knowledgeable and  accommodating and most importantly some sort of miracle worker.  Thank you Massage Envy and thank you Tommie!",pos

"I loved this place but it has been less than average lately.  I go here strictly for Taco Tuesday's.  $1.50 tacos.

First time I went here, I was amazed at how tasty the Tempura Fish Taco was.  I like how it is topped with feta cheese.  I smother my tacos with their butt burning hot sauce.  I dare try not to test the habanero sauce.

The issue is not the food.  Service, presentation, and time to get my food is what makes this 3 stars.  Their cashiers are always slow.  And the time it takes to make 2 tacos seems like eternity.  To top it off, the portions of meat in the tacos have shrank and it seems they just through everything all over the place.

I don't know what happened but this place is going down.  Hopefully it gets better soon.",neu
I went here Sunday afternoon. The decor was nice. I love the pics and movie phrases and a lot of other stuff. The food presentation was nice. My friend ordered the gumbo which she enjoyed. Also the peel and eat shrimp. Which she didn't like. I tasted one and let me tell u it was bland. I am a Cajun/creole sauce fanatic and this was not. Bubba is turning over in his grave. I had the spinach artichoke and shrimp dip which was awful and bland. I took a few bites and they happily took it off my bill. I also had the shrimp skewers that were beautiful but bland. Service was outstanding. Hostess very nice and welcoming and waiter was very attentive. I live in L.A. and go to the one on the Santa Monica Pier. The food is better there,neu

"Day: Tuesday afternoon 
Time:230pm
# of ppl: 7 (4 adults, 2 teens, 1 kid)
Price: $28.99 plus tax adults and kids over 3.
Back again? No, never! 
Tips: go for ceaser, aria or wicked spoon!

Pros: 
1. servers/employees friendly and attentive 

Cons: 
1. Price because kids don't eat much, just pizza. And I paid for two to just have 1 slice of cheese pizza. They had nothing much for kids. Go for Aria cuz kids under 12 are free! And variety and flavor was so much better. 
2. Besides from the usual crab legs that everyone goes for (which I didn't eat) the food had No flavor in any foods. It was just bland. Nothing that I wanted to say ""oh this is amazing!!"" And never went for seconds on anything. Food was very basic! No creativity!! Seriously, mash potatoes and gravy?! BBQ chicken (that's the only chicken dish besides rotisserie, and all they did was slather BBQ sauce on it) beef brisket, Green beans, plain mushrooms, plain corn on the cob, chicken noodle soup, cheese, pepperoni/veggie pizzas, cheese pasta? Mac and cheese? It seemed all like cafeteria sort of foods. Normal Sushi rolls that you can get at any grocery store?! The salad was just a salad bar with 3 types of lettuce and toppings?! Plain shrimp with cocktail sauce, breads and butter, usual fruit, usual dessert. Look at my pics. I suggest Ceaser, Aria and wicked spoon!! They won't be the usual mediocre cafeteria foods, I promise!",neg

"This was my first time visiting this location and, unfortunately, my last.

Confused by the valet service being offered, my boyfriend asked the two gentlemen working if we could just park our own car. The first man sarcastically told us that only he or his counterpart could park our vehicle, but if we *really* wanted to do it ourselves we would have to do so a few blocks over. The two boys cackled as if this was the greatest joke they've ever told. 

Not sure whether or not their rude, frat bro-like demeanor is simply a side effect of their North Scottsdale upbringing and are annoyed that daddy made them get a job after getting suspended from W.P. Carey or paying a hefty sum to bail them out on a coke-fueled DUI charge, or if their behavior is classism at its best because we pulled up in a Toyota iA instead of the usual Mercedes S-Class they're used to seeing. 

I am honestly not one to complain at restaurants. Having worked at a handful in the past, I know how difficult it can be serving ungrateful, picky customers when working at slightly over minimum wage and only making barely enough to cover rent. However, I have never felt more insulted in my life. I'm not sure if the valet company is separate from the establishment itself, but regardless it should be noted that this is completely unacceptable behavior. I am so put off after this experience and refuse to give my money and service to any Vig location from this day forward.",neg

We talked for a good 20 minutes about what I would have done at my old salon, and we discussed my color and cut and ways to change it up and make it more fresh looking.

"I came here for restaurant week and was very excited to try it.  I got the watermelon feta salad, hanger steak, and lemon tart.  The salad was not what I had hoped. It was very boring with watermelon that were not exactly ripe.  Most of them were white in color and bitter.  There were 3 pieces of arugula...what do you with that?! And the dressing was scarce and flavorless.  

The hanger steak was cooked as I asked, medium.  It was extremely fatty and I could not finish it. The tart was ok, I tried my friend's chocolate PB mousse, which was very good.  The meringue on the tart was my favorite part of the whole meal, which is disappointing because I spent $40.  

I hate writing bad reviews and I hate complaining, but seriously?  It's pretty frustrating when you try a place for the first time, look forward to it all day, and get the results I got here.

It is absolutely marvellous Looking at the large Aquarium. It is truly admired Aquatic experiences and feelings.

On the plus side, kids liked the simple pizza, pasta and make-your-own sandwich areas. Also the assortment of salads was reasonable, if you don't expect too many vegetables. However the sushi was dry and its rice still crunchy. The sausage was cold and Spanish rice not fully cooked. Two of my favorite dishes, bok choy and eggplant parmesan were overcooked beyond recognition. I wanted to give it one star but the service was good and kids liked some of the food.",neu

Hubs- cracked molar, needed deep tooth cleanse and sent to In-house Root Canal Specialist, Dr. R.  All experiences with booking and experience were impeccable.

Host took my name and entered my phone number to ensure my place in line and to text me since I walked next door for a few minutes. 15 minutes later Im seated at a 4 top even tho I was alone. I said I would happily wait for a 2 top but she said I had waited long enough and that was that! 

Ordered seaweed salad, agedashi tofu, assorted sashimi and hot sake. Everything was great but I wish the tofu had been cut in smaller pieces which would make it easier to eat but still very nice. Not a fan of white tuna...its actually escolar which can negatively affect some people when eaten raw...I just pass on it...love it when cooked through like at Miga. All in all a great meal.

"The word you are looking for is pretentious, there are better, cheaper, more comfortable or classier or more hip/fun restaurants in Toronto for less. The portions are pitiful, I get what they are trying to do, a tapas style sharable plates, it is not lost on me. I can see the hours of thought and work put into making a menu the owner might find creative. The execution however is a total miss. If you want to do tapas, then do real tapa style food, a cup with 5 overcooked potato wedges in them does not/shouldn't count as one, nor does it warrant a 5 dollar price tag. 

This was definitely the most confusing dining experience I have had, not only was the menu confusing, the food, style, execution was all over the place, you will find oysters, full burgers ($20!! Please just go to Burger Priest), trout salad with a few leafs of vegetables and even fewer juliennes of bland trout scattered over a plate ($20?), asian inspired cauliflower ($14) and loads of other undistinguishable items both in flavour and name.

This is a bar first, but if you want better atmosphere go literally anywhere else on the same street, if you want good food, save your money and go literally anywhere within 2 blocks of here, if you want to have hipster gatherings on other people's dime and then pretend to like small generic at best food, then this might be the place for you, although there are still better choices for that.

Just a hunch, based on the menu style, the name, and the ambience, it is trying really hard to be the Blackhoof. I can see why, since it is an insanely popular and very lucrative restaurant. However, to put them at the same level is really unthinkable, they both have a ignorance and pretentiousness to them, but at the end of the day, only one puts out hearty and great tasting food, that satisfies your pallet and your curiosity, while the other one not only falls short, but leaves you with a ripped off feeling $100+ later.",neg

He rations pickles, olives and tomatoes too! I can't handle it!! I will never return. He has done this too many times.

The manager came over and was very standoffish. He explained the fine print ""clearly states"" they did not accept groupons during Restaurant Week. Sure,  ok. Did not need to belittle us and be pompous but apparently that is this places style. 

Also, where I'm from Restaurant Week is an attempt to make Restaurants more accessible not less. Their tasting menu was 3 courses. The first was a $6-$7 appetizer, the second was a $15-$17 entree. The third coarse was a choice between 2 desserts. That makes those desserts worth around $14 since this menu cost $35.

"First off I'll start by saying our waiter was amazing! Johnny ran his butt off to make sure our table and all others surrounding were taken care of.
However.. The food was so-so.
Another issue we had was watching Johnny and his fellow server run around taking care of customers, however as the restaurant started to fill up, it would have been nice to see help from other work employees such as the two bartenders that stood around on the phone and playing with their hair. Team work is key when dinning in somewhere, if your server is busy, it wouldn't hurt to help run food and drinks.

It was 10:55pm they close at 11 and we were only on pur 4th course. We paid the full $212 for 3 people. And left the next day i called to speak to a manager and where they refunded $70 based on the fact that we didnt finish our last two courses. They argued that the time that we had experience even at 9pm to 11pm that is 2 hours not 1.5 and we still had 2 courses left. HOWEVER that is not my biggest consern. My consern is you trust them to keep you safe as you are completely vulnerable in the dark and yet there was no one in the room with us for at least 20 min. We had no way of calling them but yelling and they still didnt come. One of my friends that was with us is very much afraid of the dark and once we realized we were alone. We were all un easy exspecially her. We felt very taken advantage of and disrespected by the responce we got. I suggest a policy change where someone is in the room at all times. It is irrisponsable and dangerous for there not to be. Go at your own risk if there is not a policy change.",neg
"Booked a room as a stopover on our road trip. A nice cool and cosy stopover out of the hot deserts before we headed on to Vegas and beyond! The room has a very comfortable bed, a luxury after many nights camping! Very friendly staff and great service for us!",pos
"Bad bad customer service!!  I was willing to give this place a try. Came in to make some purchases and was completely ignored. Employees were busy conversing among themselves. Waited for about 15minutes for them and was told ""some one will be with you shortly"" so i just walked out. Best if you take business to Healy or AZ guns!",neg
"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Gluten-free pizza is amazing and they offer to change their gloves and has the pizza on a separate pan. Workers are so nice and always make my day. This is a great modern, up beat, fast ordering and cooking, pizza place. You go through the line and tell them exactly what and how much of something you want.",pos
Amazing ! I love their oatmeal chocolate cookie ! The best. The vibe is so chill. I recommend this place to everyone. The staff is so nice and friendly. The coffee is amazing as well.,pos
"Slow food served fast. Good quality and quantity for the price. It is definitely a perfect place for college students who are hungry and want their food immediately at a cheap price. Bibimbab comes out the quickest. I would like to recommend the spicy pork bento, chicken teriyaki bowl, and oishii roll if you are visiting for the first time. Everything is in a take-out system and the place itself is quite small. It may not seem like a family-friendly place to dine-in but I've seen many families come and sit for the food as well.",pos
