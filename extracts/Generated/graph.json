I expected the UK to be rainy, but unfortunately didn't bring proper shoes. The trek to Glenkinchie involves a 45 minute long bus ride, and then walking for about two miles to the distillery on a dirt road. I knew this would be unpleasant, but I couldn't rationalize not TRYING to go. So we went.

We waited at the bus stop for nearly 30 minutes because the bus was late. This didn't seem so surprising, given the weather conditions. We met some nice Germans from Dresden who were also making the trek to Glenkinchie, and chatted them up. At least we had friends to accompany us on our trek! On the bus ride, we saw flooded playgrounds (water up to the tall beam of swingsets), suggesting that this long spell of rain was not to be expected. Lucky us.

Almost to the end of the line, and the bus pulls over, and the driver in his thick Scottish accent tells us we must get off and board a van. I kid you not, we boarded a van (the four of us) that took us to the end of the line. We were hoping he would magically drive us to the distillery, but alas, he dropped us off two miles out and we made our trek in the sprinkling rain. The rain could have been much worse, but I'm not sure my shoes would have noticed; they were soaked through after 10 minutes of walking. Parts of the road were covered in water, resulting in attempts to cross at the shallowest part. Hey, my shoes were already wet! Did it really matter, at that point?

In the last half mile to the distillery, after clearing the path for several cars who drove right past us, a car pulls up and offers us a ride to the distillery. Wet, cold, and uncomfortable, we warned him that we would dampen his car, but he took us on anyway and drove us the last half mile to our destination. 

By the time we finally got to the distillery, there were actually tons of other tourists there, who looked at us with a bit of disdain. Ah, the things we do for scotch.

The guy who gave us the tour was great, and we paid for the premium tasting at the end. It was here that I discovered my love for Islay malts (Lagavulin is delicious) after previously categorically rejecting them based on the barbecue smoke flavor. Josh K. even picked up a souvenir glass.

They are owned by Diageo, and there is definitely a corporate feel to the whole distillery. I learned a lot though, and overall, it was worth the day's excursion. This could be the effect of buying an expensive mattress (you've already spent the money/time anyway, so you might as well extoll the virtues rather than making yourself feel worse), but I would not have been satisfied had we not attempted to make it out here."},{"source": "2MMGdtPsdEcGz-sIiCjtdw", "target": "AnXbqBBa4tZ21RbPWpKoqg", "type": "red", "rv": "What a cool way to spending a morning...yes a morning whisky tasting!

Firstly getting to the Distillery can be a bit of a trek.. about an hour on the bus, from town ..no sweat then its about a 45 min walk, great if its a fine day, but if you are planning to go, their is a chap that will pick you and your friends up for ¬£6 and give you a lift to the distillery ( you'll find a board at the bus stop with the mobile on) after the distllery tour he will pick you up and talk you back to his pub ( a couple of metres away from the bus stop) and ask you to buy a drink. Thats is all for being so friendly and driving us there and back!
The distillery was really enjoyable, and although i am not a fan of whisky i still like to learn and taste! We tried 4 malt whiskys inlcuding a Glenkinchie 12 and 15 year old, a Tallisker and Dimple, We were toured by a lovely women, who had a great knowledge of it all! it cost ¬£12 per person for the 4 malts at the end and ¬£7 for two , including the tour ofcourse.

At the village bus stop we phoned the need a lift guy and he took us and 5 Koreans to the distillery. As long as we promised to have a drink at his pub on the return trip. 

We used a Group On voucher for a full tasting an tour. Which normally would have been ¬£12 each. We were greeted by a young fella who took us on the tour. He was very knowledgeable and we got a good laugh. He took also care to speak clear and plain so the Koreans got to understand the trip as well. We learned how the whisky is made, prepared and kept for maturing. Also what  angel's share  means. They are part of the same company that makes Johnny Walker, Lagavullin, Dimple and the likes.  They are located around a well. This well is kept behind lock and Key, in a big closed off barn like structure without windows.  Very mysterious. 

After the tour we got to taste some samples. 12, 15 and distillers special. Then it was exit through the gift shop. 

The pub landlord cum taxi driver picked us up and we took a few drinks in his pub, before long the bus showed and we went back on our jolly way to Edinburgh. 

The trip in total took the best part of 4 hours.

The whisky itself is as mild as you get - and a great introduction to those who want to step a trembling toe into the golden-hued waters of this particular aqua-vitae. For those who like a peaty smokey flavour, it won't put up much a of a fight to convince you. 

We went on the basic tour. I was the designated driver (no encouragement of drink driving thank you very much... although I was chastised by a slightly humourless cashier for making a joke about excessive drinking) so my samplings went to my partner in crime, though not too many (as per chastisement). Although I was a little peeved that my joke fell so flat, have to give the lady credit for being responsible about an establishment that positively encourages drinking... although clearly more of the appreciative type rather than binge (have you ever tried to slam a shot of whisky down? I don't recommend it). 

The tour itself was great - Daniel, our guide was friendly and coped with our never ending barrel of questions. We struck out - a tour of just ourselves and missing the tour buses that were filtering in and out of the distillery. He clearly enjoys his trade and took us through the distillery, seemingly ad libbing along the way. 

At the end, my friend got to try numerous samples whilst figuring out a suitable gifts to take home to his family and got more than we paid for. Nice service and no rush about standing supping away on his drams. 

When you buy the tour you also get a fiver off (per ticket) a bottle of whisky. The G-man bought 2 bottles and got a tenner off using both our tickets - so not sure if it's a fiver per bottle or multiple tickets can be used against one bottle. It's a nice little incentive. 

Glenkinchie is owned by Diageo, a pretty large drinks corporation. It's changed since my last visit, and the marketing side is very clear. Not sure how I feel about big corporations (I have an inclination to compare Diageo to MacDonalds versus a small holding selling their wares) but at the end of the day, Glenkinchie is a pleasant afternoon trip out for (mainly) adults, as well as a pleasant whisky."},{"source": "6NyCuNp_sSxE1qDW8eDydA", "target": "-ZM78Lp6guNOiE6yJNAJHw", "type": "blue", "rv": "Residents & Visitors to Musselburgh alike are fortunate to have 2 superb ice cream parlours in very close proximity.

Following a walk in nearby Newhailes I stopped off here with my family for a milkshake. On reading the menu however I realised that I wanted EVERYTHING. Now I have been a frequent visitor of Luca's in Morningside through the years , and have always enjoyed the legendary praline parfaits irn bru sorbet and burgers. However I havent been much in the last couple of years as I feel the service has really gone downhill, which is a real shame.

Not the case here, the original Lucas. The menu seems to have had a few extras and options added on since my last visit around a year ago and I plumped for a red cola ice cream float(2 scoops of ice cream) and onion rings which were really fresh tasting and delicious. The atmosphere was busy and bustling but the staff friendly and efficient. Clearly most of the locals were out for the first sunny evening we have seen in a long time. As I was leaving I realised I couldn't leave without some more of the yummy, home cooked comfort fare in my tummy. So after a look at their takeaway menu(almost the entire menu, pasta, pizza, full english breakfast) i decided on lasagne, salad and chips. About ten minutes later, it was ready. SO tasty, Not fancy food, but filling without being heavy and it such a treat. 

Luca's is really good value I think I couldn't help noticing a takeaway flat white  coffee was ¬£1.50  and I know from previous visits that the coffee is really good. I think if I lived here I'd be in all the time. While I much prefer the atmosphere  in this branch I'm certainly going to pop into the more mums and toddlers Morningside branch again soon.

We decided to sit in one Saturday during a day trip to the East Lothian coast. The place is very popular, so it took them about 10 minutes to get us a table. However, I tend to view this kind of popularity as a good thing. :)

Indeed, S Luca proved worth the wait. I ordered a milkshake, Mary had a coffee, and we both had scones with jam and cream as well. The milkshake was absolutely DIVINE. I've getting tired of hot chocolates lately, but I still wanted something sweet to enjoy, and the milkshakes at S Luca are just wonderful. Made up of generous portions of an ice cream of your choice, and with two thickness options, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying one.

Scones were okay, I've certainly had nicer ones, and the use of whipped cream instead of clotted cream was a bit disappointing. Pricewise, S Luca is a little more on the expensive side, but the quality of products on offer is great. At neighbouring tables, we saw people eating the lunch food options, and all of that looked good as well. I definitely intend on returning here in the future.

Loretto, being the private school (then, boys only) and relatively elitist with such alumni as Alistair Darling. Anyway, apart from avoiding being beaten up by the local kids (Note... Andy was about 15-20yrs older than me at the time. Nor myself or any of my friends were involved in such torments) for wearing the Loretto uniform, his favourite memories were of Luca's ice cream. In fact, everytime I saw him drunk, he'd demand, once more, that I bring him some next time I went home. Sadly, I let him down everytime. Hopefully that didn't leave too long a lasting scar. 

Anyway, during the summer, queues flow out of the door. There is a cafe there whose menu has scarecly changed in 20 or more years - snowballs, sundaes and parfaits grace the menu. But if it ain't broke? The only difference between now and when I was a child is there are more choices to pick from at the take-away section - for years, t was limited to chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Full fat Italian ice cream to die for... so rich it starts melting as soon as it hits room temperature. Creamy and sweet, it's hard to compare other ice creams when few really meet the same high standards.

That's brutal for me, because I try to look for the best in everything. Maybe my expectations let me down a bit. Granted, I think if I had just walked in for a wee cone and left about my business to enjoy some ice creams, I would have rated this place far higher. As it was, my partner and I decided to sit down and enjoy some quality time and coffee inside Luca's. As far as I can tell, that's something I wouldn't hasten to do again!

First of all, the layout of the place made me a bit hesitant. We came inside, strode past eye-catching displays of glorious gobs of goodies, chocolates and ice cream and more. Leaving all this behind to stand in a dark hallway to wait for a seats left me feeling rather uncertain: how would I know which ice creams to get when the display was so far away? (Ice cream-aholic concerns.) Eventually we were escorted to two seats, and that's when I got a good look around.

Luca's is NOT a place for fine dining. In fact, it has the appearance of a pretty shabby diner. It looked like people's meals were all standard stuff, sandwiches and the like, but the seats and tables themselves were rickety plastic affairs. It all seemed pretty hastily slapped together and crammed in, to boot. We were practically breathing down the necks of the people next of us, which makes for a kind of hushed dining experience.

We ordered coffees, a flat white and a hazelnut latte, which arrived promptly. Points for that. However, when we decided on our ice creams based on a little chalk board that a server presented us with when we asked what our options were (no printed list? strange!), we were surprised to be greeted with a wait of around 10-15 minutes for said goodies. I mean, it was a busy day for them, understandably. But ... to scoop out some ice cream? How long does that take?

The ice cream, when it did show up, was delicious. At least mine was--the strawberry cheesecake in particular was delightfully sweet. I did end up rather confused by the flavors of my own ice cream though, unable to tell what I'd actually gotten in the end. Maybe that's just me not knowing what toffee fudgy wudgy should taste like. But I was convinced I had actually gotten salted caramel.

In the end, if I ever spotted a Luca's around in the future, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in for a cone if need be.

I will start by saying that the food was great. It is cooked fresh in an open view kitchen, and is very reasonably priced. But, the service was so slow!
It took:
-          an hour for the first 2 of our 3 orders to arrive,
-          a further 5 mins for cutlery to arrive (they had run out!!),
-          then another 5 minutes again before the final meal was served.

The Quayside is conveniently situated almost right on Musselburgh beach, with a picturesque harbour opposite, small boats tied up...you get the picture, on sunny weekends or during festivals is packed with some type of private function. But with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, I felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early June.

The party I was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local Haddington newspaper. Well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. So thanks to the Courier as the organiser!

The decor inside the Quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. Another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2. There is a lift for people that don't fancy or can't do the walk, but it's not that quick!

With adequate parking to the rear and side of the venue overlooking the harbour, it really pays to park as close to the venue as possible, especially as it rained heavily on the day in question, so it kind of ruined those precious wedding photos!

Wedding food was faultless but was it really that price(¬£75each according to the Bride's father), but we did get champs upon reception. Red and White wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). With all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when I requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!

Food booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. To any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. To make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. With reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.

Speaking of food, Quayside renamed their restaurant as the World Buffet,(does exactly as is says). The name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. But with many foods available (and I did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit. But I ask you, after unlimited buffet food not many peeps will have room for fruit anyhow?

Requiring another visit to experience since I was there for a wedding so couldn't appreciate this mass buffet experience. My mission should I choose to accept it is to find out, but if  the wedding food was anything to go by, they'll probably be ok???

They also have freshly made pretzels and numerous different types of bread. 
I have had the flasche kaser (?)which is basically a huge slab of processed meat (not unlike spam!) in a huge round patty in between a white roll with mustard on top. Simple, meaty and straight to the point, very German. (you can also get some Viennese sausages in a roll.)
The food I've had here seems to be authentic but more importantly it's delicious.
The coffee is also very good.
They have a limited number of German bottled beers to take away, I presume you can drink them there also but not sure. 
One minor quibble, the latest time I was there the pretzel was slightly dry, as if it was yesterdays. But that's the only thing in a 4 or 5 visits.

For instance, when she asked us what we wanted to drink, my partner politely asked her if she had 'appletiser' to which she curtly thrust a menu in front of him and told him that all the drinks were listed on the menu. When I asked for further clarification on the handling of nuts and in particular whether the bakery handles peanuts, I was curtly asked whether or not I had in fact read the 'disclaimer' about nuts on the menu. Despite the menu stating that if the customer needs further clarification as to the bakery's handling of nut products, she should feel free to ask, this waitress was unwilling to offer any further clarification and was unwilling to disclose whether or not the bakery handled peanuts, which was our main concern.

We recently visited Falko for a quick coffee break before heading to the beach.  It's the ideal in between stop!
I could not resist to try something new and ordered their Fleischkaese, which normally is called Leberkas on the continent. The meat was served with a Semmel (White roll) and German mustard, which is slighty milder than the French mustards.  The Viennese coffee is black coffee, most likely of continental origin,  and has quite a full rounded taste to it. The milk on the side comes served in a cow shaped piece of carafe that looks pretty quirky :-) 
They sell a large selection of breads, from Rye, Sourdough to multi grain. The ice cream offered in the summer is deliciously creamy and there are a few flavours. 
There is only one small toilet,  which is unisex. Not the most up to date toilet, but bearable. 
The staff is very nice and offered to help to get more Maple syrup when they noticed they had run out. Yes, I had to change my order from pancakes to something else. One thing is for sure. I will be back, even if it's just to try the pancakes :-)

It wasn't clear if we were supposed to seat ourselves, order at the counter or wait for someone to speak to us.

The lady nearly fell over herself to run to the table while I followed trying to explain that we didn't know what we wanted to order, or how to do it. Menus appeared from another table. When the order was taken, the waiter (male this time) was a little short in response, but I wouldn't say rude.

My friend had the bacon roll and sweet potato, chilli and roasted pepper soup, while I went for the set breakfast of a hot drink, pretzel and cheese. Got to say, his bacon roll looked pretty good, with nice thick slices of bacon. My pretzel seemed tough to cut, but tasted fantastic and not as heavy as I was expecting. It beat a hangover egg roll any day of the week. 

As Falko is a master baker, I felt I had to try the Black Forest Gateaux, as it was waxed lyrical about on the company website.

Sharing a giant plate of nachos to start (definitely a meal for 2, even for the four of us it was big); we followed it up with chicken milanese (average); king prawn linguine (good); and spinach and feta pie. The pie came with salad and chips (delicious chips - frozen, but seasoned with something that became sneakily moreish); no dressing on the salad. All in all pleasant, if a little forgettable.

Restaurant 102 offers a variety of Scottish dishes, including a variety of locally sourced meats and seafood.  It has a bit of a rustic interior and has an almost cabin-ey feeling to it with it's wooden floors, photographs of local sunsets and a mix-and-match arrangement of wooden chairs and tables.  

There is a wide variety of dishes on the menu. We had a coupon that allowed two starters and two mains, plus two glasses of champagne for ¬£24.95.  The regular prices for most dishes are reasonable (¬£9.95 for fresh haddock and chips.  I saw one of the plates and it was a massive portion!).  

I had a pesto tortellini with tomatoes, red onion and black olives as my starter.  Starters range in price from about ¬£3.95 to ¬£6.95 and are a taste-tester size to get your palate warmed up for the main.  My partner had a starter-portion of haggis, neeps and tatties with a mustard-whisky sauce.  I must admit that my starter was nothing to write home about. It sounds a lot nicer on the menu than it actually tasted, with the pasta being way over-cooked and not much flavour in the pasta itself. Most of the dish's flavour came from the tomatoes, onions and black olives that were mixed in with about 5 tortellini shells.  I would not recommend that particular starter in future but there were plenty of other things to choose from including a smoked duck Waldorf salad, king prawns with mango and marie rose sauce; and nachos.  I tried a bit of the haggis starter. It was much nicer than mine but expect more neeps and tatties than haggis, and a miniature version of it.

For mains there is a wide selection from seafood, burgers, chicken dishes and several different types of steak. Since we wanted to make the most of our coupon, we both opted for the 8 oz fillet steak with garlic butter (blue cheese and pepper sauces are also options), chips, mushrooms, onion and tomato (regular ¬£17.95).  I was expecting the steak with a few bits of the garnish and maybe a stack of 8 chips.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good bowl-sized portion of chips, big mushrooms, lots of onion and half a tomato.  The steak was perfectly cooked and as a whole the meal was delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant on the basis of its reasonable prices and the steak dinner alone.  It was also noted on one of their chalkboards that Tuesday is steak night where you get two steak dinners and a bottle of wine for ¬£25.  They also seem to have a variety of theme nights including an African Safari featuring exotic meats such as Ostrich, Kudu, Antelope and Zebra between March 25 and 27th.

And the naan was just smelling of garlic-buttery spectacularness.  I very much enjoyed my dish, though it did have dairy in it...  I should have suspected, but usually the menu gives an indicator if the sauce is to be creamy or not.  Still, very nice indeed.  Having tasted a sneaky bit of the lamb bhuna, I can also attest that it was also very tasty, and the naan bread was just as good as it looked and smelled!

Based on food, this would be a 4 star review, but the big let-down was the service.  Our waiter, though polite and attentive, was just a bit miserable and seemed to want to do the bare minimum to check the customer service box.  I almost felt as though we were intruding in his domain just a little bit.  Perhaps it was because we were the first people in that night, I'm not sure.  I would still eat here again, though.  The food is definitely worth a second go."},{"source": "rHhSEfvw5RnXj4njY2098Q", "target": "oaCyww7fGQOzvbSFT07Wrw", "type": "blue", "rv": "Brilliant sandwich shop I must be one of their best customers! It's always busy, the staff are all friendly and the food is brilliant.


 They do filled rolls, baguettes, paninis, homemade soup, burgers, and hot filled rolls too. Their baking is also lovely - they do massive scones with clotted cream, cheesecake, truffles etc. In winter time they have a roast and hot rolls/ baguettes which are great.


 Definitely recommended if you're about this way and need a bite to eat. I like the bacon, brie and cranberry paninis."},{"source": "rHhSEfvw5RnXj4njY2098Q", "target": "ZOznPYj15VdpyxYbNwsMLQ", "type": "red", "rv": "A brilliant sandwich shop where everything is really fresh and made to take away.

To be honest, I wasn't that impressed and didn't go back again until it re-opened as The Birdcage.

If you don't know the area, you would probably struggle to find the place as friends of mine did when they came to meet me. Unfortunately its located behind the job centre in Musselburgh, however, if you can find the place, its a lovely venue, modern inside, large bar area in which you can eat and drink and they also have a  restaurant area through the back, nice booths which seat 2-4 peeps.  I do like a booth!  Its quite a different establishment to other eateries in Musselburgh and if you didn't know otherwise and were sitting merrily drinking, you might think you were in Edinburgh.

I've eaten in here a few times now and haven't been disappointed.  In fact, their pork belly, is by far the best I've had in a long time. Succulent and crispy as you expect from pork belly, served with red onion mash, spring greens and a gorgeous rich jus which I have on occasion, been tempted to lick!  Again, photo posted for maximum drool factor when we dined here in September and oh yes, had it again in Oct, Nov..and so on.;o)

I can't quite move away from the goats cheese starter as its my absolute favourite cheese just now, but I have tried the thai fishcakes and they were good and my boy has tried the mussels and seafood chowder and gave both of them the thumbs up too.

Price wise, you do notice a drop in prices compared to Edinburgh, so that's a good thing, on both the food and the alcohol.   Mondays and Tuesdays you can dine 2 for 1 on main courses so its a bargain.  They also offer 2 dine for ¬£29 where you can get a starter/main or main/pudding plus a bottle of house wine.   I've tried this and whilst the menu is restricted to 3 choices per course, its still excellent value at less than ¬£15 per head.

Midweek I've found the place to be quiet, but Saturdays its a busy buzzing place.   I just hope that the locals continue to support this place, as will we, because it is a very good addition to East Lothian and for me, only a short bus journey down the road! ;o)"},{"source": "svUIpXqYx0m0mJ6h6rBN0w", "target": "hbapKIUn5fxSmsqATcMo7Q", "type": "red", "rv": "Another hidden gem - you would not know it was there!

I'm a fan of tea, all kinds of tea, ALL THE TEA! But I am especially a fan of afternoon tea, high tea and cream tea. So you can imagine how pleased I was when I saw a Living Social deal for afternoon tea which included Prosecco AND a cocktail for a very reasonable price.

Very.

So off we went to Musselburgh, having never been it was an adventure. It was more of an adventure when we tried to find the place, all tucked away. It's an odd place for a restaurant/cafe, in the middle (literally) of a business park! The building looks like an old part of the Esk Mill has been reconstructed by keeping the front and replacing the back with a huge glass conservatory. When you walk in it looks quite chic and modern, you could be in the middle of New Town. 
The barman saw me walking in and picked me out despite the party that was going on. He asked me if I had a reservation and when I said yes, he said 'You must be Sara'....well that's service!
We were seated in the back, glassy, area. Decorated with some beautiful wallpaper, exposed pipes and birdcages hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is a mish-mash of leather couches and wooden chairs. 
The tea itself was grand, we had a glass of cold Prosecco poured for us and then we were presented with sandwiches, tarts, scones and some delicious banana cake. A huge thumbs up for the vanilla infused whipped cream, they know what I like!

The negatives of this place to me are the location (I had to get 2 buses from work, then got lost...but adventure!) and, weirdly, the flat bottomed sinks in the bathroom...they just make no sense, a teensy bit of pressure from the tap and BAM your front is splashed.  Overall it was a lovely visit and if I'm out that way I'll definitely pop in (I could smell mussels at one stage and they smelled divine!)"},{"source": "svUIpXqYx0m0mJ6h6rBN0w", "target": "NeYPCyHw0Tp67N1ebDCnjw", "type": "red", "rv": "Hmmm....despite the surroundings the staff at the birdcage didn't get off to the best of starts...
A beautiful sunny day with an entire restaurant empty and the only other table besides ours was next to us outside. In spite of having more staff than you could shake a stick at I still had to go inside to firstly get hold of a menu so that we could order. We were quite hungry so thought a couple of snack plates out in the sunshine would be nice. 10 minutes later we'd still not had our drinks order taken. Along comes a waitress...one Passionfruit Margarita and a coke please. No problem. 10 minutes after that someone comes out to say that I'm sorry we have no passionfruit would you like a normal Margarita? No worries, yes please. 10 minutes after that a lady comes outside with the one drink, the Margarita...erm excuse me we ordered a coke too please. Oh sorry, I'll just go and get it for you... 5 minutes later it arrived. She didn't even ask if we would like any food. My god not that we would now given the it's taken 35minutes to get a drink in an empty restaurant/bar...

The menu however does look nice. Perhaps we will give it a try during one of their 50% off days as if we receive the same level of service I won't feel so enraged with half off the meal.

The Jury is out but in the meantime I'm giving this place a 2 and it's only really for the surroundings not the minging Margarita or the poor poor service."},{"source": "wpxOONw8VYNPvvlVdR9L0g", "target": "X2uF3C3YBD24xcgKA104Sw", "type": "red", "rv": "The Goth is a rather nice pub in which I spend an inordinate length of time these days. Why? Sadly, not to fuel a drinking habit. The Goth is one of those pubs that is a little social hub, hosting groups such as the choir I attend, art classes, rugby club shindigs and the like. 

There is the main pub, a restaurant section and upstairs, a bar/lounge area that tends to be the area where private events are held. The space itself is bright, and the pub itself is popular, and seems to build a level of loyalty amongst those that frequent there. They have their own microbrewery as well, but I haven't tried that as of yet. Rather cool though - as you can peek in to see it as it is at the back of the main room itself. 

Foos wise, it's all rather pleasant, if not exciting. But, there are lots of reasons to like it - gluten free is available, and there are a couple of decent vegetarian options. Their cullen skink is a meal in itself. I also visited recently for a rather raucous Christmas meal, dining on homemade fishcakes and vegetable crepes... which when it came out was a sizeable beast, rather than the dainty item I had imagined. All very nice food and definitely a worthwhile option if you find yourself peckish in the vicinity of Prestonpans.

Created using the shell of an old wine/beer shop Haddows, it is squeezed in between an electrical shop, a beauty shop and opposite a pub, but what strikes you on entering is it seems bigger on the inside! 

My venture resulted in friendly wait staff letting me know it was closed between the hours of 5-6pm, so they can set the tables for evening meals. Upon asking if it was possible to just order a coffee I was asked to come in. While I didn't have time for a bite to eat the coffee did the job and heated me up, also included there was a small biscuit which sufficed the hunger...temporarily. I also ordered from their small range of cakes, shortcake complimenting the coffee well.

Sitting down on comfy leather seating and tables that hugged each wall of an L-shaped room, ordered a white coffee and scoped the surroundings. Wooden flooring, coupled with mocha and cream/white finish on the walls - with additional water feature on the wall near the door, 3D styled curvey white ceiling, completed with snaking multi coloured neon lighting, the ambience made me feel comfortable.

Designed with attention to detail in mind, little alcoves dotted around are filled with flora, giving a distinct Mediterranean feel overall. Also they have free wifi so excellent for work, but didn't see any power-points for connecting laptops, maybe they are hidden? Ask behind the bar for password, but its easy to connect.

Word on the street is it's great food and chat with staff - this comes from friends and family who enjoy going there. So ultimately for me that is a calling card for a repeat visit but for booking an evening meal. But I do need to remember to pack cash as they don't yet have any form of card payment; hope this gets sorted soon?

3 stars for all above but when full review of meals completed and payment by card sorted this may change?"},{"source": "xpYAMae_yILdXWkxVBR46A", "target": "X2uF3C3YBD24xcgKA104Sw", "type": "red", "rv": "On the downside, there is a tremndous smell of stale oil as you walk up to the entrance, which isn't a great selling point, and Costco cakes in the display cabinet (with others). However, this place is definitely worth looking beyond the cover if you are in need of a cuppa or a bite to eat. I had the roasted vegetables and brie baguette - it arrived warm (warm! So little places just serve up roast veg fridge cold) which just absolutely sold me. The brie didn't work for me, but adding the houmus that was presented as part of the side salad took some of the bitterness away. Overall, I was much more impressed with Coffee Lounge than I expected to be, and like others, love the addition of a decent eatery on Tranent High Street. Pot of tea and a baguette put me back 6.50, entirely reasonable, I thought. 

Also - they sell Armenian cake - wish I'd looked past the Costco carrot cake before I apid up else I would have been writing a review of that too!"},{"source": "xzhBzPzz70wW-pd_tJrPDQ", "target": "g74l-c4UXDKTwHuScrO3sg", "type": "red", "rv": "I would have been disappointed in that sandwich if I'd paid ¬£1.80 for it in Greggs. 

The Waterside was a disappointment all round. It's a beautiful place, lovely location, and I've had nice food there before. But this time ... afraid not. 

A roast chicken and tarragon sandwich with salad in a toasted baguette - sounds good. The reality - a doughy Tesco 'bake yourself' roll, definitely un-toasted, with a tiny scoop of cubed chicken in mayo and some lettuce. You know you're in trouble when the chicken comes in cubes. And this was like the old joke, 'the food was terrible, and there was so little of it!'
